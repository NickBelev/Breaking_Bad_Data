TEASER
INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
The HEARTH fills frame.
We might not know where we are at first, because really... 
have we ever spent time thinking about our White house 
hearth?  We’ve never focused on it.  We’ve certainly never 
seen a fire inside it.
Nor is there one now.  All that’s inside the fireplace is one 
sad, dusty Duraflame log.  It lies unburned atop the grate.
We PAN RIGHT, leaving the fireplace as we slowly take a tour 
of the room.  Here’s our dining room area... here’s our 
kitchen... our hallway...
Yeah, we recognize where we are.  We’re in the White house, 
alright.  Only, it’s completely EMPTY.
We’re not talking “empty” as in no people.  Empty means no 
furniture -- not one stick.  It means nothing on the walls, 
no bric-a-brac on the breakfast bar.  It’s like the Grinch 
Who Stole Christmas.  What the hell happened here?
We continue slowly PANNING.  The living room is just as 
barren.  Walls, floor and ceiling -- that’s all there is.  
But as we finish clocking around 270 degrees...
... We reveal the house’s one inhabitant.  Here’s a MAN in a 
dark suit, standing with his back mostly turned to us.  He’s 
perusing a small notebook in his hands.
CLOSER -- he scribbles some numbers we can’t make out.  We’re 
still mostly behind him till he glances our way, checking the 
place out.  Scanning the ceiling, scanning the floor.  We 
don’t recognize this man.  He looks clean-cut and athletic.
He’s gotta be a cop, right?  A detective, or maybe DEA?  
Jesus, what the hell happened here since 312 ended?  Walt ran 
those Bulletheads over with his car, and now the entire house 
is empty!  Is it a crime scene?  Did the White family go into 
witness protection?
KNOCK-KNOCK!  Someone’s at the door.  The man tucks away his 
notebook and opens the front door.  Nice salesman’s smile as:
REALTOR
Well, hello there.  
Reveal he is addressing SKYLER -- whose hair is colored and 
styled differently than we’re used to.  
(CONTINUED)
And who is seven months PREGNANT.  Right behind her is WALT -- 
who has no beard or mustache, but does have a full head of 
HAIR.
SKYLER
Hi, I hope we’re not too late.
REALTOR
No, no.  Perfect timing.
SKYLER
Okay.  Stan, this is my husband 
Walt.
WALT
Hi.
REALTOR
Good to meet you, Walt.
WALT
Nice to meet you.
REALTOR
(he and Walt shake)
Sandia Laboratories, huh?  
WALT
Yeah.
REALTOR
I hear some pretty fascinating 
stuff goes on out there.
WALT
(no big deal)
Yeah, well, you know...
REALTOR
Wworking on anything you can talk 
about?  I’m picturing giant space 
lasers.  Am I right?
Walt shrugs politely -- I can’t really talk about it.
WALT
Honestly, what I do would bore you 
senseless.  Giant space lasers?  
Now that sounds cool.  I’ll have to 
bring it up at our next staff 
meeting.
REALTOR
Well, just remember I get a cut!

WALT
Alright.  It’s a deal.
Everybody chuckles good-naturedly.  Walt glances around the 
living room.  This is the very first time he’s laid eyes on 
this place.
So here’s the deal:  we are watching a FLASHBACK to 1993.  
Our characters are sixteen years younger.  Skyler, we can 
guess, is pregnant with Walter, Jr.
Wardrobe is of the period.  Perhaps most striking is how Walt 
is dressed.  No Wallabies or beige for our boy.  With faded, 
well-fitting jeans, a bright rugby shirt and moccasin-style 
driving shoes with no socks, Walt is... dare we say it?  Hip.  
He’s got color in his face.  He’s youthful, vigorous.
He and Skyler are relaxed, happy newlyweds.  Throughout this 
Teaser, they smile and stand close and touch one another 
without giving it a thought.  Knowing, as we do, how cold and 
pinched their relationship will eventually become, seeing 
them this way is a bittersweet thing.
Anyway, back to it.  This is the second time Skyler has 
toured the house, so she takes the lead here.  To Walt:
SKYLER
So... this is it, honey.
(off his polite nod)
Whaddya say?  Do you wanna take a 
tour
WALT
Sure. 
SKYLER
Okay.
REALTOR
Uh, look.  How ‘bout, uh, I give 
ya’ll some privacy?
(thumbs over his shoulder)
I’ll, uh, go out to the car, make a 
few calls, and uh... take as much 
time as you need.
SKYLER
Okay, thanks.
WALT
Alright.
The Whites smile and nod.  The man exits, leaving them alone.

SKYLER
He’s actually a nice guy.  He 
doesn’t push.
WALT
(noncommittal)
Yeah.
Eyeing him subtly -- but closely -- Skyler takes Walt by the 
hand and leads him on a tour.
SKYLER
So, as you can see, there’s a kinda 
flow going on here.  It’s a nice 
big living room.  And this is the, 
um, dining area.
WALT
Ah, the dining “area.”  Right.
She pulls aside a sheer drape so Walt can glance out the 
patio door into the backyard (obviously we’ll still need 
window treatments to hide the fact we’re on a stage set -- 
but maybe they can be DIFFERENT ones).
SKYLER
(tah-dah!)
Oh, and uh... it’s got a pool...
WALT
Pool is nice.
(eh)
Backyard could be a little bigger.
SKYLER
And oh, there’s uh, a breakfast bar 
kinda dealie here, which is nice.  
And um, the kitchen’s really 
spacious, and you know... got good 
appliances, and
Taking no offense, Skyler steps out of frame, heads down the 
hall.  Walt follows.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY/VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS
We FOLLOW Sky and Walt as they tour the back of the house:  
the hallway; the nursery; Jr.’s room; the master bedroom.  
God help us, this will likely be STEADICAM.

(CONTINUED)
Lighting-wise, though it’s easier said than done, let’s try 
and be prepared to have a continuous run of all these areas, 
and hopefully pull this off in one long ONE-ER.  All of the 
following dialog plays on the MOVE as they tour.
WALT
How many bedrooms?
SKYLER
Three.  Told you.  They’re all 
pretty good size.
(re: the nursery)
Oh, and this is the first one here.  
And there’s-there’s two more at the 
back.
WALT
Only three bedrooms?  I think we’re 
gonna need at least five, dontcha 
think?
SKYLER
(good-natured)
Five?  What, do I look like I’m 
about to drop a litter?
WALT
(smiling)
No-no-no-no-no.  We’ll have three 
kids total, eventually.  You know, 
but well need a spare room for a 
study so that I can work at home... 
and you can write...
(glances into back rooms)
Yeah, nah.  TI don’t think this is 
gonna be enough.
Skyler definitely likes the sound of a study for her writing.  
Three kids total, eventually, sounds fine too.  Nonetheless:
SKYLER
Okay, um, about a wine cellar?  I 
mean, we certainly cannot be 
expected to live without a wine 
cellar.
WALT
Very funny.  I just think we need 
to set our sights high is all.  At 
least higher’n here.

SKYLER
Walt, this is a good neighborhood.  
It’s got a good elementary, and 
supposedly a very good high school.  
And believe me, ‘cause I have 
definitely looked everywhere -- for 
our price range, this is as good as 
it gets.
WALT
Well, then, let’s stretch our price 
range.  Truly.  I mean why... why 
buy a starter house when we’ll have 
to move out of in a year or two.
Skyler frown/smiles at him.
SKYLER
Did you win the lottery and not 
tell me?
They’re back in the hall by this point.  Walt grins and pulls 
her close.  They are full-frame, in SILHOUETTE.
WALT
I’m serious.  C’mon... why be 
cautious?   We’ve got nowhere to go 
but up.
Jesus, he’s confident, this Walt of old.  Pragmatic as she 
is, Skyler loves it.  Off them silhouetted, kissing...

ACT ONE
EXT. CORRAL - DAY
Against a blue sky with fat clouds stands a crooked, ancient 
FENCE POST.  It supports a rusty curl of barbwire.
VARIOUS ANGLES now:  an empty watering trough; the remains of 
a livestock pen; assorted junk and detritus.  We’re out in 
the middle of nowhere.  For miles around, there’s nothing but 
half-dead grassland and distant mountains.
This old livestock corral, unused for decades, is the only 
reminder of civilization.  And beside it...
... Is parked Walt’s AZTEK.  Its GRILLE and FRONT BUMPER are 
broken and dented -- souvenirs of their recent impact with 
the Bulletheads.
INT. AZTEK - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Walt waits out here alone.  He keeps his eyes peeled, 
scanning the horizon ahead.  He checks behind him in his 
mirror.  He doesn’t want anyone sneaking up on him.
He glances at his watch, stares back out the windshield.  
Nothing out here but the breeze, murmuring through the ruins 
of the corral.  Making the tall grass dance.
Whatever Walt is out here waiting for... it’s big.  Like, 
Treaty of Versailles-big.  He’s nervous, but keeps his nerves 
in check.
Actually, for a man who murdered two people mere hours ago, 
all things considered?  Walt has his shit pretty well 
together.  No pangs of guilt or remorse.
He’s here in the moment.  He’s calculating.  In fact, maybe 
in a sense, this isn’t even Walt we’re watching.  Maybe this 
is HEISENBERG, so long removed from the scene.
Always scanning, now he sees something.  His eyes narrow, 
focusing on it.
Walt’s POV -- a BLACK SPECK drifts into view, creeping along 
the horizon.  Sunlight GLINTS off it as it moves.
It appears to be a Suburban or somesuch.  It heads our way 
for awhile, then turns and travels laterally, keeping its 
distance.  Finally it comes to a stop a couple of hundred 
yards out.  We hold on it a beat, straining to see.
BREAKING BAD #313         "Full Measure"        AS BROADCAST       7.
(CONTINUED)
Walt wishes he had brought binoculars.  He sits motionless, 
staring.  Silence, save for the breeze.  As we and Walt wait 
on pins and needles for something to happen...
... RING!  Walt’s CELL PHONE startles us.  He fumbles it out 
of his pocket.  He raises it to his ear as if it might bite.
WALT
(a beat)
Yeah.
MIKE (V.O.)
Walter, you see us?
WALT
Yeah.  I see you.
MIKE (V.O.)
I’d like you to exit your vehicle 
and start walking toward us.
WALT
And then what?
(off the silence)
I’m gonna need some... some kind of 
assurance.
A faint, impatient SIGH.  And then:
MIKE (V.O.)
I assure you I could kill you from 
way over here, if it makes you feel 
any better.
CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Walt closes his phone and 
considers, then climbs out of the Aztek.
EXT. CORRAL/GRASSLANDS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Walt shuts his car door and starts walking...
... And walking.  The other vehicle is still just a black dot 
on the horizon.  Walt moves at a measured pace.  Not too 
fast.  Not too nervous.  Not visibly, anyway.  Goddamned if 
he’s gonna let these bastards see him sweat.
In the distance, a dark FIGURE climbs out of the Suburban.  
It walks toward us, moving at a similar, stately pace.
We alternately PULL Walt along, or FOLLOW high over his head 
and shoulders.  We linger awhile on this long walk of his, 
the tension building.  Think Sergio Leone.

(CONTINUED)
Is Walt a dead man?  It’s starting to feel that way.  But if 
this is really it, maybe he’s going out in a blaze of glory.
Ahead, the figure closes on us, revealing itself to be MIKE.  
Mike strolls with his hands in the pockets of his dark 
windbreaker.  The sun is BEHIND him, putting him in partial 
silhouette -- good planning, that.
Twenty feet... ten... now Mike and Walt stand face-to-face, 
halfway between the two vehicles.  Dry as toast, like always:
MIKE
Walter.  You’ve been busy.
(then)
You wanna put your arms out to your 
sides for me, if you would.
Walt does as he’s told, standing motionless as Mike gives him 
a quick yet thorough pat-down.  Mike’s an old pro at this.
All clear.  Mike motions politely -- after you -- and the two 
of them head for the Suburban, walking side-by-side.
MIKE
You know I haven’t slept since 
Thursday?  I was out all night 
cleaning up after you.  I need my 
sleep.
Mike isn’t angry, just matter-of-fact.  More than that, 
actually.  Is he surprised?  Is this grudging admiration?  
Today, he’s seeing Walt in a whole new light.
WALT
You said no half measures.
MIKE
Yeah?  Funny how words can be so 
open to interpretation.
(glancing back)
You get your car fixed?
WALT
Not yet.
MIKE
You’re gonna wanna get your car 
fixed.
WALT
(his eyes on the Suburban)
Let’s see how this goes first.

(CONTINUED)
Mike shrugs, nods -- prudent.  They keep walking.
EXT. SUBURBAN - DAY
In b.g., Walt and Mike head our way as we ADJUST to find the 
Suburban in f.g.  VICTOR climbs out from the driver’s seat.  
He stands waiting beside the hood.
Inside the truck, we can make out the back of a third man’s 
head.  He sits motionless, watching Walt approach.
REVERSE to reveal this is... GUS.  He, too, climbs out.     
He stands his ground.  He does not look happy.
Walt arrives, standing before him.  Silence.  Then:
GUS
Has your condition worsened?
WALT
(a beat)
Excuse me?
GUS
Your medical condition.  Has it 
grown worse?
WALT
Not that I know of, no.
GUS
Is there a ringing in your ears?
(Walt shakes his head)
Are you seeing bright lights, or 
hearing voices?
Walt stares.  Gives the slightest shake of his head.
WALT
I’m quite well, thank you.
GUS
No, clearly you’re not.  No 
rational person would do as you 
have done.
(I’m waiting!)
Explain yourself.
Unlike Mike, Gus is angry.  In control as always, we can 
nevertheless hear it in his voice -- he’s downright pissed.
Nervous as he is, Walt stands his ground.  Doesn’t flinch.

WALT
My partner was about to get himself 
shot.  I intervened.
GUS
Some worthless junkie.  For him you 
“intervene” and put us all at risk.  
Some contemptible junkie who 
couldn’t keep the peace for eight 
hours.
WALT
That’s right.  He couldn’t.  He was 
angry because those two dealers of 
yours had just murdered an eleven 
year-old boy.
GUS
I heard about it.  He should have 
let me take care of them.
WALT
Maybe.
(then)
Then again, maybe he thought it was 
you who gave the order.
Gus narrows his eyes a little.  Stares.  Low and ominous:
GUS
Are you asking me if I ordered the 
murder of a child?
WALT
(a long beat; then)
I would never ask you that.
Meaning what, exactly?  Meaning I myself don’t believe it?  
Meaning what would be the point of asking?  Walt is playing 
it slippery here -- both he and Gus know it.
GUS
Where is Pinkman now?
WALT
I wouldn’t know.
Gus shakes his head, not buying that.
WALT
A couple of time zones away, at 
least.  Beyond that, I’d only be 
guessing.

He has enough money to last 
forever, and he knows to keep 
moving.  You’ll never find him.
Behind Walt, Mike stirs a little.
MIKE
I dunno, Walt.  It’s what I do, 
after all.
Walt glances to Mike, then back to Gus.
WALT
He’s out of the picture.  I saved 
his life -- I owed him that.  But 
now he and I are done.  Which is 
exactly what you wanted, isn’t it?
Gus sighs and stares off into the distance.  We can’t help 
but think this is that moment of silence before something 
really bad happens.
WALT
You’ve always struck me as a very 
pragmatic man.  So if I may, I 
would like to review options with 
you.  Of which, it seems to me, you 
have two.
(a beat)
Option A -- you kill me right here 
and now.  Apparently I have made 
that very easy for you.  You can 
kill me, no witnesses, and then 
spend the next few weeks or months 
tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you 
kill him, too.
(off Gus’ stare)
A pointless exercise it seems to 
me, but that is Option A.
Victor subtly glances to Mike -- who stands with his head 
cocked, considering Walt closely.  The balls on this cat!
Gus, meanwhile, gives nothing away.  He just stares.
GUS
What is Option B?
WALT
I continue cooking.  You and I both 
forget about Pinkman.  We forget 
this ever happened.

WALT (CONT'D)
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
We consider this a lone hiccup in 
an otherwise long and fruitful 
business arrangement.
(then)
I prefer Option B.
Gus continues staring inscrutably.  A?  B?  Who knows?  This 
really feels like it could go either way.  Finally...
GUS
You’d need a new assistant.
WALT
(nods -- yes)
I could get right on that.
GUS
No.  This time I choose.
Walt may not love this, but he can’t argue.  He’s lucky to be 
alive.  He nods.  Agreed.
Done with Walt, Gus turns and heads back to the Suburban.  
Victor does too, climbing behind the wheel.
Walt hesitates only a moment before he realizes he’s been 
dismissed.  He turns and starts off on the long walk back to 
his Aztek.  We PULL him away from here.
As we pass Mike, he turns our way, calling after Walt:
MIKE
Your car.  Get it fixed.
WALT
(never looking back)
Yeah.
Mike, too, climbs in the Suburban, which grows small in the 
distance as we PULL Walt away from it.  The truck’s engine 
roars to life and it turns and drives off.
Now that he has won his survival and the moment is over, 
Walt’s face shows all the fear it’s been masking.  His knees 
are ready to buckle.  Off our hero, chugging onward:
EXT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - MORNING
It’s a day or two later.  The start of a new week.  We PAN 
off the familiar laundry building, with its WORKERS streaming 
in for the start of their shift, to find...

WALT (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
... Walt’s Aztek motoring onto the property.  As it drives 
toward us, its grille prominent in frame, we note that all 
the hit-and-run damage has been REPAIRED.
Walt parks it in his usual spot, cuts the engine and climbs 
out.  He pauses to notice what’s parked beside him.
It’s a muddy Subaru Forrester with a mountain bike atop the 
roof rack and an old “Ron Paul for President” bumper sticker.  
As it’s in Jesse’s spot, we can assume this vehicle belongs 
to Walt’s new assistant.  Anyone care to guess who that is?
Walt already knows.  He turns and heads for the laundry.
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING
As seen through the small window in the lab door, Walt 
descends into view in the stairwell and pulls his key from 
his pocket.  We hear it in the lock -- yet, judging by Walt’s 
frown, it doesn’t seem to work anymore.
Into view comes Victor, who opens the door.  Hesitation as 
Walt considers stone-faced Victor, then steps past him onto 
the catwalk.  Victor shuts and locks the door behind him.
WALT
Really?
NEW ANGLE -- Walt descends the spiral staircase.  Girding his 
loins, he crosses the floor of the lab toward a MAN who 
stands waiting in f.g.
This man wears a yellow Tyvek cook suit.  His back is to us, 
so we don’t yet see his face.  Walt forces a smile.
WALT
It’s good to see you.
Yes!  Reveal... GALE.  Who smiles his own self-conscious 
smile.  We’ll remember Gale Boetticher as the perfect lab 
assistant whom Walt fired in episode 308.
Is he bitter?  He doesn’t seem to be.  He shakes Walt’s hand.
GALE
Thanks.  It’s good to be back.
(glances around the place)
Well.  Shall we..?
WALT
(nodding)
By all means, Gale.  Let’s cook.

ACT TWO
EXT. QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - AFTERNOON
We’re at the curb in front of a row of nice suburban houses.  
An n.d. Buick pulls past us into frame and parks.  We can’t 
make out who’s inside -- all we see through the rear window 
are a dozen or more shiny MYLAR BALLOONS.
MIKE (V.O.)
What about that rhinoceros?  You 
think he’d make a good pet?
GRANDDAUGHTER (V.O.)
No!
MIKE (V.O.)
No?  Don’t you think if you called 
to him, he’d come running for his 
supper?  I’ll bet he would.
INT. BUICK - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS
Mike sits behind the wheel, smiling down at his adorable 
little GRANDDAUGHTER whom we met briefly back in episode 302.  
She is safely seatbelted beside him.  She half-frowns/half-
beams up at her Pop-Pop in a way that just melts your heart.
MIKE
I’ll bet he’d come running -- BOOM, 
BOOM, BOOM -- 
GRANDDAUGHTER
You’re silly Pop-Pop.
MIKE
Well... a little.  But he’d 
probably knock everything over.  
Plus, there’s that big nose of his.
GRANDDAUGHTER
That’s not a nose, that’s a horn.
MIKE
Is that so?
GRANDDAUGHTER
His real nose is little.
MIKE
Huh.  I learn all kinds of things 
being with you.

feeling smart.  Off Mike, unlatching her seatbelt for her:
EXT. QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - AFTERNOON
TIME CUT -- moments later.  CLOSE ON the backseat door of the 
Buick as Mike pulls it open.  Inside, the back is filled with 
all those metallic helium balloons from the ALBUQUERQUE ZOO.  
They bob against the roof, a rainbow of colors.  Mike hands a 
few to his granddaughter, who stands by.
MIKE
Okay, Junebug, these are for you?
The little girl frowns up at the three measly balloons she’s 
got, then points at the dozen more that are still in the car.
GRANDDAUGHTER
What about the rest?
MIKE
The rest are for me.
GRANDDAUGHTER
(smirks)
No, they’re not.  You’re too old 
for balloons.
MIKE
Oh, you’re never too old for 
balloons.  
Mike shuts the door, serious about keeping them.  He bends 
down -- careful, bad back! -- and gives her a hug and a peck 
on the cheek.
MIKE
Give me a hug.  I see your Mom.  
Don’t keep her waiting.
GRANDDAUGHTER
Bye, Pop-Pop!
MIKE
Bye, baby.
The girl prances off, headed up the walkway of a nearby 
house.  A WOMAN in her thirties stands waiting on the porch.  
She waves to Mike, who waves back.
Ah, what a kind, sweet granddad Mike is.  But what does he 
want with those balloons?

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
A smallish, pre-fab warehouse squats on a cracked and weedy 
ribbon of concrete in what seems to be the middle of nowhere.  
Security lights surround it, glowing sickly yellow.  A few 
cars are parked out front.  No one is in sight.
We’re looking upon this scene from maybe fifty yards away.  
PULL BACK to reveal Mike standing by his Buick, watching the 
warehouse from the cover of darkness.
REVERSE -- Mike stands with his hands buried in the pockets 
of his windbreaker.  After a moment, he glances at his watch.  
No time like the present.
He’s wearing black leather gloves.  He unzips his jacket and 
reaches inside for something.  We hear a few CLICKS of metal 
on metal as he performs some ominous task o.s. (what he’s 
doing is threading a silencer onto an HK mk23 pistol, in case 
props needs to order one for us).
CHI-CHIK!  Mike cycles the pistol’s slide, still o.s., then 
tucks it back in his windbreaker.  He opens the back door of 
his Buick and gathers all those colorful toy BALLOONS.
Grasping a fat fistful of strings, he wanders toward the 
warehouse looking like Luigi the Vendor.  What the hell is 
his plan here?  Some of us will begin to understand as Mike 
heads for... the POWER POLE that feeds the building.
It’s a lone wooden pole with a transformer on it, sending 
several sagging cables down to the warehouse in the distance.  
Mike positions himself directly beneath it.
CRANE ANGLE -- we cut to a bird’s-eye view from above, 
looking down at Mike far below.  As we watch, he lets go of 
his balloons, which float straight up toward us until they 
envelop the power lines and...
... ZZ-ZZZAP!  Short-circuited by the metallic Mylar, the 
transformer BLOWS with a blinding blue ARC-LIGHT FLASH and a 
huge shower of SPARKS.

SECURITY CAMERA VIEWS of the outside of the building.  BLINK!

Battery BACKUPS click on, half-lighting the place in 
dramatic, moody fashion.  A hard-looking MEXICAN MAN steps 
into frame, glancing around overhead.
FIRST MEXICAN MAN
(in Spanish)
What do you think?
A SECOND MEXICAN MAN steps into frame, passing him.
SECOND MEXICAN MAN
(in Spanish)
Only one way to find out.
He pulls a PISTOL, checks that he’s got a round chambered.  
The first man does the same.  Both of them head for the front 
of the building.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Wide tableau -- up a short flight of steps, there’s a door 
with a window.  The faces of the two Mexican men appear in 
it, peering outside.  The door eases open.
First one man, then the other, steps outside.  Guns at the 
ready, they squint into the darkness, scanning for trouble.  
They don’t see what we see.  A mere ten feet away, hidden 
just around the corner of the building, waits Mike.
The first Mexican descends the steps, drawing closer to Mike 
without realizing it.  The second man remains by the door.
Old Mike, cool as a cucumber, stays motionless.  That is, 
until he... cracks his neck to one side.  If you’ve ever seen 
“Yojimbo,” you know that’s what Toshiro Mifune always does 
right before he slices up a bunch of ne’er-do-wells with his 
samurai sword.
Hearing this faint SNAP, the Mexicans freeze.  The man atop 
the steps whispers down to his partner.
SECOND MEXICAN MAN
(in Spanish)
What was that? --
Mike instantly steps around the corner and SHOOTS the nearest 
man point-blank through the head.  And what a shot!  The 
bullet continues on into the second man, standing atop the 
steps.  It even passes through him, SHATTERING the window in 
the open warehouse door beside him.

Two guys with one bullet!  Mike doesn’t wait for applause.  
On the move and headed up the steps, he aims without looking 
and -- THUP-THUP-THUP! -- puts three more rounds into the 
groaning second man, finishing him off before he disappears 
inside the building.
INT. WAREHOUSE - FRONT OFFICE - NIGHT
We may have already noticed it outside, but the name of this 
place is in MANDARIN.  The front office is wood-paneled and 
seedy.  Papers lie scattered across the floor.
Crossing the room, Mike hears a SOUND behind an employee 
counter.  He raises his pistol, ready to fire.  He pauses 
when he sees...
... A middle-aged CHINESE SECRETARY sitting on her butt on 
the floor, her feet splayed toward us.  She holds up her 
hands, talking scared and fast.  We don’t have to speak 
CHINESE to realize she’s begging for her life.
Mike raises a finger to his lips, employing the universal 
symbol for “shut the fuck up.”  Glancing down a darkened hall 
that leads to the back of the building, he considers a 
moment.  He glances back to the secretary.
SECRETARY
Please... please...
Mike hunkers beside her and takes hold of her nearest foot.  
She stares at him saucer-eyed -- what the hell’s he doing?  
He wiggles loose her PLATFORM SANDAL, gently... tugging it... 
off her toes.
Taking cover, Mike whips it underhanded, like a bocce ball.  
ZI-IIP!  There goes that SHOE, noisily tumbling the length of 
the hall and drawing out --
-- A THIRD MEXICAN MAN.  With a ferocious YELL:
THIRD MEXICAN MAN
AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHH!! --
From the other end of the hallway, he runs STRAIGHT AT US, 
FIRING wildly.  BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  
Blinding bright MUZZLE FLASHES strobe the dark walls.
He overshoots (no pun intended) the end of the hall and comes 
skidding out into the front office -- passing Mike, who 
stands safe and sound against the wall.  Mike raises his 
silenced pistol and THUP-THUP!

Turning his back on this freshest dead man before the dude 
even DROPS, Mike pads down the dark hall toward the far end 
of the warehouse.
INT. WAREHOUSE - HALLWAY/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Mike’s MOVING POV:  lit by backup lights, we can make out 
stacks of STEEL BARRELS.  Apparently, this is some sort of 
chemical supply facility.  As we travel further down the 
hall, we heave into view of...
... A plump CHINESE MAN.  He sits at his rat’s nest of a desk 
in a short sleeved Arrow shirt and clip-on tie.  He stares at 
us wide-eyed, raising his hands in surrender.  This is CHOW.
Mike pauses before he exits the hall.  Some sixth sense tells 
him not to step any further.  Maybe it’s the way Chow sits 
frozen and unblinking, just staring at him.
REVERSE ANGLE -- popping WIDE past Chow, we get the whole 
picture now, seeing what Mike can’t see.  There is a FOURTH 
MEXICAN MAN hiding just on the other side of the hallway 
wall.  Gun poised, he waits to ambush Mike.
Mike figures as much.  Silently pressing the muzzle of his 
pistol to the sheetrock, he looks to Chow for confirmation.
With those raised hands of his, we figure Chow’s too scared 
to do anything.  Until... very gingerly, very subtly...     
he EASES his hands HIGHER.
Noting this, Mike correspondingly SLIDES his pistol HIGHER.  
Now it’s a bit too high -- just over the bad guy’s head.
Chow LOWERS his hands a bit, splitting the difference.  Mike 
slides his pistol LOWER, glancing to Chow -- good?
Chow blinks and gives the teeniest little nod.
THUP!  Mike FIRES through the sheetrock, nailing the hidden 
man right in the melon.  A STARBURST of BLOOD paints the wall 
next to him.  His legs go out like a marionette’s with its 
strings cut.  He slides down the wall, landing on his butt 
and slumping forward.
Mike cautiously (not nervously) peeks around the corner, 
noting dead guy number four.  He looks to Chow, who keeps his 
hands in the air, having forgotten they’re up there.
Gazing through those perpetually half-lidded eyes of his, 
Mike doesn’t look happy.  In fact, he’s downright put-out.

Hey lady, are you still there?

Ask her if she’s still there.
CHOW

Peng, are you still there?
Pends responds at length in Chinese off-camera.  
CHOW
She says yes.
Mike nods.
MIKE
How’s her driving?
Chow blinks, confused by the question.  Helping him out, his 
gun still in hand, Mike mimes a steering wheel.
MIKE
Driving.  Is she good behind the 
wheel?
CHOW
Good.  She’s good driver.

Abruptly, Mike raises his pistol and -- THUP! -- puts one 
through Chow’s raised LEFT HAND.  AAAAAHH!
Chow grips his BLEEDING palm, his face contorted in agony.  
Mike turns his back on him, squats down to check the nearest 
dead man for ID.  Over Chow’s whimpers of pain:
MIKE
The trucks’ll be here first thing 
in the morning.  I strongly 
recommend that you return our calls 
next time.
(hearing no movement)
So..?  Have her drive you to the 
hospital.
Holding his hand, Chow rises and stumbles toward the hallway.  
Just as he clears frame...
MIKE
She’s gonna need her shoe.
Chow stumbles back into frame and picks up the woman’s SHOE 
with his good hand.  Seconds away from fainting, he plods 
back out of sight.  Off icy Mike:
INT. LOS POLLOS HERMANOS - OFFICE - NIGHT
CLOSE ON a desktop -- FOUR “LASER VISA” BORDER CROSSING CARDS 
get plopped down into frame.  These are cards issued to 
Mexican residents by the U.S. Government, providing entry 
into the United States.  These represent the four men Mike 
killed.  We may recognize them from their PHOTOS.
A second hand reaches into frame, examining the visas.  
Reveal Gus.  He sits at his desk, Mike seated opposite.
GUS
Where’d they cross?
MIKE
Laredo, looks like.

Gus doesn’t seem so sure.  His long, thoughtful silence makes 
Mike uncomfortable (if such a thing is possible).
In fact, if such a thing is possible, Gus looks troubled.  
Gus versus the cartel is Fischer versus Spassky.  As skilled 
as he is, Gus intends to play this right.
Figuring it’s time to leave, Mike rises from his chair.  Gus 
glances up at him, onto a new subject.
GUS
What about Pinkman?
MIKE
I’m making inquiries.
Gus stares -- find him, his look says.  Mike exits.
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
CLOSE -- HEAT HAZE and VAPOR rise like steam coming off the 
world’s biggest bowl of soup.  It’s an abstract image, this.  
We don’t know where we are at first.
Two FACES materialize through the fog and heat.  It’s Walt 
and Gale, wearing respirators and tending to the enormous 
mix/cook tank.  Into it, they scatter handful after handful 
of shiny ALUMINUM FOIL STRIPS, sprinkling them like confetti 
into the brew (though we likely haven’t shown this till now, 
it’s an honest-to-goodness step in our meth cook).
WALT
That’s two.  Alright, let’s close 
it up.
Done, Walt shuts the tank’s heavy lid.  
WALT
Alright, bring it down.  Ready?  
Okay, we’re good.
The vapor quickly subsides, and he and Gale remove their 
masks.  Looking to someone o.s., Walt indicates his own bare

Walt, he pulls off his mask and continues reading.
Efficient, chipper Gale is already cleaning up the spilled 
foil (of which there’s a lot).  He sweeps it into a dustpan.
Gale nods -- he thought as much.  Walt grabs a broom and 
helps sweep.  As they work, Gale shoots a wary glance across 
the lab at Victor.  He speaks sotto voce.
GALE
Does that guy ever leave..?
Walt shrugs, noncommittal.
GALE
When exactly did that start?
WALT
It’s new.  We had some, a uh...

Nah, nah... it’ll fine.  Things’ll

Walt smiles bittersweetly at this eager young man.  A beat.

Okay.
Gale senses this is supposed to be an apology -- or at least 
as close to one as Walt can get.  And he appreciates it.
Off Walt, head down, returning to his sweeping...
INT. CLUTTERED APARTMENT - NIGHT
VARIOUS CLOSE-UPS paint a picture for us.  We see:
-- Overflowing shelves of BOOKS on science, art, photography, 
history, travel, philosophy, poetry, Stephen King, etc.
-- PHOTOS of world travels show us scenes of backpacking 
through Mongolia, Machu Picchu, Kilimanjaro, you-name-it.
-- A kit-built digital clock that runs on a POTATO (available 
at Edmund Scientific) tells us the time is 7:08.
-- A SNOWBOARD is propped in a corner.  A fat Cassegrain 
TELESCOPE sits atop its tripod.
Under all of this, MUSIC plays on a stereo.  It’s something 
ITALIAN.  
... GALE is SINGING ALONG to it.  This is his colorful pad, 
and as he waters his many and various HOUSEPLANTS, he sings 
along in whatever language is being represented.
Talk about a guy who digs life.  Gale’s the happy-go-luckiest 
meth cook there is.  As he hits a long high note with gusto, 
a KNOCK on the door turns his attention.
Hmm.  Who could that be?  Setting down his watering can and 
answering it, Gale is surprised to find...

If push came to shove, I was 
wondering how soon you might be 
able to take over the lab yourself.

He’s dying of cancer.

ACT THREE
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING
Reddish-brown GUNK fills frame.  A gloved hand reaches into 
view, scrubbing away the gunk with a sponge and leaving shiny 
stainless steel in its wake.
Reveal Gale outfitted in his yellow Tyvek, scrubbing the big 
mix/cook tank.  This is an activity we last saw in episode 
310 -- the CLEANUP that precedes the cook.
Never one to shirk his duties, Gale is nevertheless kind of 
distracted this morning.  He’s not his typical chipper self.  
His scrubbing slows as he glances across at...
... Walt, who works the opposite side of the tank.  
Eventually feeling eyes on him, Walt glances up from his 
scrubbing.  Friendly but quizzical:
WALT
What’s up?
Gale forces a smile, shakes his head -- nothing.  He throws 
himself back into his work.
After a moment, he changes his mind, looks up again.
GALE
Walt.  Is there, um...
We can guess what’s weighing on Gale:  Walt’s cancer.  But 
whether or not he would have brought it up, we’ll never know.  
Because now, as if on cue...
... Victor idly wanders into view.  He sidles up beside Gale, 
glancing down into the tank.  He doesn’t even look at Gale, 
pays no attention to him.  Yet, there’s a message here.
Innocent as he is, Gale gets it.  Covering nicely:
GALE
... any particular trick to purging 
the catalyst bed?
Appreciating Gale’s interest, Walt shrugs, shakes his head.
WALT
No, it’s pretty straightforward.  
I’ll show you when we get there.

that’s all.  I’m like a mother hen.
INT. SAUL’S CADDY - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS
Saul drives.  Walt sits beside him.  Both men stare out the 
windshield, not looking at one another.
SAUL
Believe me, money-laundering ain’t 
what it used to be.
(half to himself)
God, do I miss the eighties.

WALT
You’re wasting your time -- I’m 
buying the car wash.  End of story.
SAUL
Well, one look at this place, 
you’re gonna fall in love, so...
Our two guys ride on in silence.
EXT. GALACTIC LASER TAG - DAY
A deserted parking lot.  The Caddy motors into view, crossing 
the lot and arriving at a closed-down (but intact) business.  
“LASER TAG,” the sign blares.
Saul and Walt climb out, Saul proudly presenting the place.
SAUL
Huh?  Was I right?  Where else you 
gonna find a cash-only business 
that’s this much fun?  Unless  
we’re talking massage parlor, and, 
uh... I don’t see it!
(dangles the keys)
Shall we?
Hands on his hips, Walt studies the building, then nods.  
Saul steps past him, unlocking the front door.
So what’s going on here, exactly?  Cowardly Saul just gave up 
Jesse, and now he’s all business-as-usual?  Distressing.
We MATCH-CUT to a NEW ANGLE -- we’re suddenly seeing Saul and 
Walt from a couple hundred yards away.  
Into the f.g. of this shot drives... VICTOR.
Clearly, Victor followed them here.  Just as clearly, he’s 
keeping his distance, not wanting to be seen.  Off him, 
raising a small pair of BINOCULARS and surveilling Walt and 
Saul as they disappear into the laser tag:
SAUL
You ever actually play laser tag?  
You know... it’s good cardio.  Plus 
you get to shoot at kids...

INT. GALACTIC LASER TAG - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Saul locks the door behind them.  He and Walt stroll through 
the place, Saul flipping switches and turning on lights as 
they go.  This joint is colorful, to say the least.
SAUL
You got your bumper cars over there 
down the way.  Got your arcade 
right here -- all the latest video 
games.  Snack bar’s over there.  
Nothing stopping you from selling 
beer to the parents.  That’s a 
whole new revenue stream...
WALT
(glances over shoulder)
... Alright, alright, alright 
already.  We’re-we’re good.
SAUL
Holy Christ.
Saul stops dead, puts his hands on his knees and sucks in a 
deep, ragged breath.  It’s as if he’s trying not to faint.  
With his eyes, he shoots Walt daggers.
SAUL
“We’re GOOD?”  This constitutes 
“good” where you’re from?  My car 
is bugged --
WALT
-- I said “maybe.”  Maybe bugged --
SAUL
-- I’m being followed?!  What the 
hell have you gotten me into?!  I 
got my very own PI threatening to 
break my legs!  That’s like Thomas 
Magnum threatening, that, that...
(can’t think of it)
... Little prissy guy with the 
mustache...
Another deep breath.  Recovering, Saul stands up straight.
SAUL
Over and above.  Service-wise, this 
is over and above.  You and I 
survive this?  Oh, I’m seriously 
rethinking my pricing.  Yeah.

And that goes double for you, Hip-

Who’s he talking to?  Reveal... JESSE, cautiously stepping 
into view from out of the darkness.
Hurray!  Saul’s not a Judas!  He has, however, done his one 
good deed for the day, and with that...
SAUL
My guy’s no dummy, right?  So, I 
give us maybe twenty-four hours 
before he figures out that address 
goes nowhere.
(off the grim silence)
You guys do your thing, make it 
snappy.  I’ll go... see if they 
have Tetris or something.
Shaking his head to himself, nervous Saul wanders off toward 
the arcade, leaving Walt and Jesse alone.  A beat.
WALT
How you holding up?
Jesse shrugs -- not great, but okay.
JESSE
You..?
WALT
I got my old job back.
(wryly)
At least, until they kill me, and 
Gale takes over.
Wow.  So Walt does know Gus’ plan!  Jesse seems unsurprised.  
He too, apparently is up to speed.  This is refreshing, given 
that for most of season three, our heroes have been a day 
late and a dollar short where Gus is concerned.
JESSE
So, he’s their boy, huh?
WALT
(nods; heavy-hearted)
He’s their boy.
JESSE
How long you think you’ve got?

Walt trails off, considers.
WALT
Y’know, it may be that the only 
thing saving me is Gale’s 
fastidiousness.  Once he feels 
confident that he knows my entire 
method...
Walt makes a half-hearted gesture -- that’s when they kill 
me.  Grim silence.  Now, the million-dollar question:
JESSE
So, what do we do?
Walt has a plan, alright.  He just has to work up the nerve 
to say it out loud.
WALT
You know what we do.
Jesse does -- and he hates it.  Shaking his head...
JESSE
There’s got to be some other way.
(almost pleading)
Maybe it’s better for you to just 
go to the cops, alright?  I mean, I 
can’t believe I’m saying that and 
all.  But for your family?  I mean, 
the DEA would love you -- all the 
shit you could tell ‘em?  Federal 
witness protection, that’s a good

As for me?  I’ll-I’ll hit the road,

The cook can’t stop.  That’s the

production cannot stop.  Gus can’t 
afford to.  So, if I’m the only

got leverage.  And leverage keeps 
me alive.  It keeps you alive, too.  
I think I can see to that.
(grim and meaningful)
If I’m the only chemist that he’s 
got.
Oh, no.  Is Walt saying what we think he’s saying..?
JESSE
I-I can’t do it, Mr. White.  Like 
you said, I’m-I’m not a...
(can’t even say it)
I can’t do it.
WALT
I’ll do it.  I’m gonna need your 
help.  I mean, they’re watching me 
day and night.  They never leave me 
alone with Gale, not for a moment.  
Hell, I don’t even know where the 
man lives.  He’s not in the phone 
book, I can’t find him on the 
Internet.
(ragged sigh)
I can’t do it in the lab.  Victor’s 
always there.  But if I could 
just... shake Victor, for even an 
hour one night, I think then 
that.... I may be able to...

Pregnant silence.

There’s got to be some other way.
WALT
I’m all ears.  But when it comes 
down to you and me versus him?
(shakes his head)
I’m sorry.  I’m truly sorry, but 
it’s gonna be him.
Fierce tears shine now in Walt’s eyes -- yet he’s in control.  
Yes, he’s a desperate man, but he’s being completely rational 
here.  Rational and pragmatic.  Just like Gus.

ACT FOUR
INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
The HEARTH fills frame.
It’s the exact shot which opened the Teaser.  Except this 
time as we PAN to the right, we take in the PRESENT DAY.   
Skyler works in the kitchen, preparing dinner.  Outside, it’s 
magic hour, and the light is low and golden.
We continue PANNING until we find Walt seated on the sofa, 
Baby Holly in his arms.  Recall that this is the arrangement 
Walt and Skyler made last episode, where Walt gets to have 
dinner with the family certain nights of the week.
Walt dearly loves his daughter -- but the way he’s cuddling 
her suggests Linus with his security blanket.  Walt is 
utterly preoccupied.  It’s as if there’s the sound of a clock 
ticking in his head, getting louder and louder.
It’s been a full day since his conversation with Jesse, and 
no news since.  He’s trusting an awful lot to his partner, 
and the waiting is driving him to distraction.  But as he 
sits here...
... BRRRRPT.  His cell phone softly VIBRATES.  Hopeful Walt 
digs it from his pocket, checks the readout.  Finally!
Praying for good news, Walt quickly but gently tucks Holly in 
her bassinet.  Skyler pays no attention as he pads down the 
hall, out of sight.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
Walt sits into frame on the edge of the tub, speed-dialing as 
he does so.  Hunched with his elbows on his knees and his 
phone to his ear, he tries to stay patient.  RING... RING...
JESSE (V.O.)
Yeah.
WALT
Please tell me you found him.
JESSE (V.O.)
(a beat)
Sixty-three fifty-three Juan Tabo 
Boulevard.  Apartment six.

JESSE (V.O.)

WALT
Yeah.  Sixty-three fifty-three Juan 
Tabo, number six.  Got it.
The sweet relief that is flooding in quickly runs its course, 
replaced by grim, cold reality.  Now, Walt has to actually go 
through with this terrible plan of his.
WALT
He’s home?
JESSE (V.O.)
Yep.
WALT
Anyone watching the place?
JESSE (V.O.)
No.  Looks pretty much wide-open.
(then)
When you gonna do it?
WALT
(hesitates; considering)
Tonight.  Once it gets dark.
More silence.  Walt’s body language is that of a man with an 
anvil weighing down on his shoulders.
Jesse’s voice is quiet, plaintive.
JESSE (V.O.)
Don’t do this, Mr. White.  
Please..?  Go to the cops.
Walt lowers the phone from his ear, gently folding it closed.  
He sits here overflowing with self-loathing, wondering how he 
can possibly murder poor Gale in cold blood.
Off Walt, wondering how his life ever got to this point...
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
It’s no more than ten or twenty minutes later.  All’s quiet.  
The front door opens and --
-- Walt exits into the night.  On the move, he gives a quick 
glance around.  No one’s in sight.  He crosses to his Aztek.

As he stands fishing for his keys, there’s a faint rush of 
TIRES and a sweep of HEADLIGHTS.  An n.d. sedan pulls up 
twenty feet away, blocking the bottom of the driveway.
Walt’s face drops.  Oh god -- it’s VICTOR!  Vic’s window 
powers down.  Calling to Walt, just loud enough to be heard:
VICTOR
We got a problem.  There’s some 
kinda chemical leaking in your lab. 
You gotta come with me.
Caught off-guard, Walt doesn’t know what to say.  He glances 
behind him to the house.  Struggling for a way out...
WALT
I’ll, uh... I’ll follow you.
Victor shakes his head -- uh-uh.  Matter-of-factly:
VICTOR
They tell me to bring you, I bring 
you.  C’mon, get in the car.
A chemical spill?  Could be legitimate.  Of course, Walt  
knows damn well it’s not.  It’s an excuse to get him away 
from here so he can be murdered.
This must be the night Gus intends to do away with Walt once 
and for all.  What miserable timing -- just as Walt was on 
his way to do the one thing that might have saved him!
What choice does he have?  If he runs back inside the house, 
he dooms his entire family to get massacred alongside him.
No, he’s finished.  This is it.
Reluctantly, Walt does as he’s told.  He pads down the drive 
and climbs into the front seat beside Victor.  The car pulls 
away out of frame, leaving the glowing windows of the White 
house behind.
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - NIGHT
A gray steel truck door fills frame.  Its electric motor 
whirrs to life and it noisily rolls upward, revealing...
... Victor and Walt, standing outside.  Victor’s sedan is 
parked behind them, its headlights left on and silhouetting 
them nicely.

Walt looks to Victor, who motions -- you first.  Walt enters, 
walking toward the back of the building.  Vic follows close.
Closed for the night, this place looks and sounds very 
different than what we’re used to.  There’s no steam, no loud 
clank and hiss of machinery.  There’s only Walt’s and 
Victor’s SHOES scuffling on the concrete.  Otherwise, this 
spooky, deserted laundry is quiet as a tomb.
Walt is the proverbial dead man walking.  As they travel this 
aisle of huge, silent machinery, they are forced to duck 
beneath dripping, three hundred-pound bags of LAUNDRY which 
hang from a rail system overhead.
Walt’s pace is deliberate.  His mind is silently racing a 
thousand miles an hour -- how am I gonna get out of this?!  
An o.s. WHINE of HYDRAULICS suddenly focuses his attention.
Walt’s MOVING POV:  rounding the end of the aisle, we see 
MIKE waiting.  He TILTS the enormous WASHER which hides the 
entrance to the superlab, opening it for us.
MIKE
I don’t know if it’s a barrel leak 
or what... but you got something 
mighty stinky down there.
(motions gallantly)
After you.
Down in the lab -- that’s where they’ll kill me, thinks Walt.  
Make it look like an accident, for Gale’s sake.  No threats 
have been made, no guns are in evidence.  But Walt knows if 
he goes down into that lab, he’s done.
Walt stares behind the enormous machine, breathing a little 
faster now.  He’s frozen.  Mike, mild and even, as always:
MIKE
Walter.  The sooner you figure out 
what this is, the sooner we all go 
home.
Walt does something surprising now.  Something we probably 
don’t expect.
He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE.  Low and scared:
WALT
Please don’t do this.

Mike..?  You don’t have to do this.

Holy SHIT.  WHAT did he just blurt?  Even Mike is surprised.  
But now, Walt is on a roll and there’s no stopping him.
WALT
Okay?  Like you said, he’s the 
problem!  He’s ALWAYS been the 
problem!  Without him -- we would --
(catching his breath)
And he’s-he’s in TOWN, alright?!  
He’s-he’s not in Virginia or 
wherever the hell you’re looking

Albuquerque!  And I can take you to 
him!  I’ll take you RIGHT TO him!  
Huh?

things these past three seasons -- but we never pegged him 
for a tremulous, traitorous coward.

fingers, producing his CELL PHONE.  He holds it up to Mike, 
gives a desperate, hopeful nod -- please?

INT. GALACTIC LASER TAG - SNACK BAR - NIGHT
Fluorescent paintings of imaginary worlds fill every wall.  
In f.g., two animatronic aliens slowly shake their heads from 
side to side as they pilot their flying saucer.
ADJUST off them to reveal Jesse, his back against the wall, 
sitting on the floor of this long-shuttered cafeteria.
His familiar sleeping bag lies nearby, along with a backpack 
full of clothes and a few other meager belongings.  Empty 
snack food bags and soda bottles abound.  It’s enough to tell 
us Jesse has been living here for the past week or so.
His PISTOL is here, too -- within easy reach.  Just in case.
What an existence -- hiding out, marking the endless hours 
till the heat dies down.  Worse still is the one crutch that 
gets him through all this fear and loneliness.
Meth.  Feeling lousy about himself, Jesse raises a GLASS PIPE 
to his lips and heats it with a jet lighter.  He takes a deep 
hit, holds it, then exhales a cloud of white smoke.
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  He sets the pipe aside, rubs his eyes and 
hugs his knees tight.

Mike grabs up the phone, considering it.  He’s about to say 
something into it, then stops himself.
On his end, Jesse blinks rapidly, having heard Victor and the 
struggle.  It’s dawning on him now.  He understands what’s 
going on... and what has suddenly become necessary.
Jesse launches to his feet.  CLOSE ON his PISTOL getting 
snatched out frame as he sprints from sight.
Back at the laundry, Mike hangs up Walt’s phone, pockets it.  
Quietly pissed, he turns to Walt, who stands his ground.
MIKE
Now, just what the hell was that, 
exactly?
Walt sets his jaw, gazes coolly.  He doesn’t answer.  He even 
has the intestinal wherewithal to fix his crooked collar, 
just now pulled askew by Victor.
Strongly sensing he’s been had, Mike finally draws a GUN from 
his jacket pocket (not the HK from Act Two, but something 
smaller).  Victor does the same.
Amazingly, Walt doesn’t flinch, doesn’t quake.  Far from it.

Almost immediately, Victor is RUNNING balls-out for the door.
Simultaneously, Mike snaps his pistol up to shoulder-height,

INT. CLUTTERED APARTMENT - NIGHT
CLOSE ON a CELL PHONE which VIBRATES atop a stack of books.  
This is something we SEE more than hear -- as some new piece 
of EXOTIC MUSIC that plays on Gale’s stereo is masking the 
phone’s sound.
An out-of-focus GALE passes the vibrating phone, not noticing 
it.  He’s on his way into b.g., to his kitchenette, where...
... A TEA KETTLE whistles on the stove.  His hand dips into 
frame, pouring hot water into a mug.
Gale is here alone, enjoying his night off.  As with his 
persnicketiness about coffee, he’s just as particular with 
tea:  the exact temperature, the infuser ball.  He wants it 
all just so.  He’s a man of precise and simple pleasures.
A loud KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK at the door cuts through the music.  
Wondering who this could be, Gale wanders through the living 
room, cutting off the stereo along the way.
The sudden SILENCE is striking.  Another KNOCK-KNOCK, 
sounding louder this time.  Gale opens his door to find...
... JESSE.  Breathless and wide-eyed.  Staring at him.
It takes Gale a second to place the face (remember, he only 
met Jesse one time briefly back in 308).  Ever polite:
GALE
Hi.
(off Jesse’s silence)
How can I help you?
Gale trails off as Jesse raises his GUN, taking aim.
GALE
Oh, oh... um --
Gale’s hands go up.  He gingerly backs off, not making any 
sudden moves.  He’s scared, no doubt about it.
Yet Jesse looks more scared still.  He steps into the 
apartment, closing the small gap Gale has put between them.

I have, um...
Jesse stays aimed.  His pistol hand begins to TREMBLE, but 
his eyes never leave Gale.
He tries to swallow that sideways brick that’s caught in his 
throat.  This isn’t him -- this thing he’s doing now.  This 
isn’t who he is.
Gale realizes Jesse isn’t here to rob the place.  
GALE
Please don’t do this.
(softer still)
You don’t, you... you, you don’t
