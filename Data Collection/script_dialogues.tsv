SKYLER	You want me to go ask for another?	E309
SKYLER	"A “warning call?”  What do you mean? BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      11."	E309
SKYLER	Are we safe?	E309
SKYLER	Are you safe?	E309
SKYLER	"You’ve got all these nice tulips there, and good baby’s breath... BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      15."	E309
SKYLER	Wow, look at the size of this basket.  It’s got so many goodies in it!  Look.  Chocolate-covered pretzels and, uh, cheese sticks and some fancy designer olives...	E309
SKYLER	No.  He’s great.	E309
SKYLER	"Thank God. Marie’s already racing ahead to the next logical step. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      18."	E309
SKYLER	When does he start physical therapy? The Hospital Administrator speaks up.  She thinks she’s delivering good news to Marie.	E309
SKYLER	Actually -- she asked the doctor. Both sisters turn to the man, who tries to remain politic.	E309
SKYLER	So what?  We’re just supposed to compromise on his care?	E309
SAUL	"Hey... there he is!  Finally!  I went ahead and started without you. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      21."	E309
SAUL	Ladies, this is Jesse-San.  He’s in for the full treatment. (to Jesse) Hey, kick off your shoes, lay back... exfoliate.	E309
SAUL	So, where’s the maestro?  He out parking the mini-van? The mention of Walt just annoys Jesse.	E309
SAUL	Hmm.  I was gonna have you two flip a coin.  Since the genius can’t be bothered... (screw it) Today’s your lucky day.  Look around, kiddo, it’s all yours.	E309
SAUL	Yeah.  You are now owner of this fine establishment.	E309
SAUL	"“Free?”  Oh ladies, cover your ears! (back to Jesse) BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      22."	E309
SAUL	Don’t you get it?  On the outside it’s a nail salon, right -- on the inside it’s the best money laundry a growing boy could ask for. Jesse squints at the lawyer, shakes his head and snorts -- ridiculous.  He turns and heads for the door.	E309
SAUL	Wait, wait, wait!  Hey!  Ladies, thank you, good job.  Come back here. The women drift away, busying themselves elsewhere -- texting and what-not.  Saul pulls out his toe spacers and dries off.	E309
SAUL	Sit.  Come on, come on.  Humor me for a second.  Now... you know you need to launder your money, right? (Jesse stubbornly stares) Do you understand the basics of it? Placement?  Layering?  Integration? Jesse lingers impatiently, ready to leave at any second.	E309
SAUL	"You wanna stay out of jail, dontcha?  You wanna keep your money and your freedom?  Because I’ve got three little letters for you:  I--R- -S.  If they can get Capone, they can get you. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      23."	E309
SAUL	Hey look.  Here’s you, right? Pink, Pinkman -- get it? Saul dumps cotton balls out of a clear plastic container to represent money.  He’s trying a little too hard to keep his explanation on Jesse’s level.	E309
SAUL	‘Kay.  Here’s your cash.  You’re out on the town, yeah, you’re “partying hearty,” you’re knockin’ boots with the chicky babes.  And -- uhh -- Who’s this? He hovers the open side of the plastic box threateningly over the pink nail polish and the cotton balls.	E309
SAUL	It’s the Tax Man.  And he’s looking at you.  Now what does he see?  He sees a young fella with a big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job.  Now what is the conclusion the Tax Man makes?	E309
SAUL	Bzzt!  Wrong!  Million times worse - - you’re a tax cheat!  What do they do? THUD!  Saul slams the box down, trapping the cotton balls.	E309
SAUL	They take every penny!  And you go in the can for felony tax evasion! He stomps open a pedal-style trash can and swipes the nail polish right into it.  He lets the lid close with a CLANG.	E309
SAUL	"Ouch!  What was your mistake?  You didn’t launder your money.  Now, you give me your money -- that’s called placement.  Hand me that little thing... BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      24."	E309
SAUL	This is the nail salon, right?  I take your dirty money and I slip it into this salon’s nice, clean cash flow.  That’s called layering. In spite of himself, Jesse grows interested.  But that doesn’t mean he’s buying it.	E309
SAUL	Final step: integration.  The revenues from the salon go to the owner -- that’s you. Saul spills out Q-Tips mixed with cotton balls.  With pride:	E309
SAUL	Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean, taxable income brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business. Logically it makes sense, but playing by the rules -- even criminal rules -- rubs Jesse the wrong way.	E309
SAUL	Yeah, and if you want to stay a criminal and not become -- say, a convict -- then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer. Now Jesse sees Saul’s angle.  This is all a sales job.	E309
SAUL	No, that’s seventeen percent.	E309
SAUL	Yeah, that was for your partner. Privileges of seniority and all -- but for you it’s the usual seventeen percent, and... that’s a bargain. But as soon as Saul starts talking about Walt, Jesse’s already on his way out.  Saul calls after Jesse.	E309
SAUL	Hey, what?  Hey...  Listen to it! Come on!  I’m talking about your future here!  Listen to reason! Off Jesse, out the door and gone...	E309
GUS	How is your brother-in-law?	E309
GUS	"Good.  I’m glad. (off his silence) Walter, you seem troubled.  How can I help you? Carefully controlling his voice, Walt gets down to business. He’s meticulously planned every word.  He speaks them softly. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      27."	E309
GUS	Well, that’s the best way to do business.	E309
GUS	What would you like to happen?	E309
GUS	Then you have it. But what does that mean, exactly?	E309
GUS	"Three million for three months, that was our agreement.  Extended annually, twelve million a year. (then) Call it fifteen.  Open-ended. Would that be agreeable? Once Walt would have jumped at it.  Now, he simply nods yes. Walt has his 30 pieces of silver.  By extending, he assures his continuing usefulness to Gus.  But at what cost? BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      29."	E309
SKYLER	They’ll say they’re not denying coverage. (before Marie can argue) No-no.  I’m agreeing with you.  But I went through all this with Walt. You’ll burn through your savings, and then what?	E309
SKYLER	What?  No!  No-no-no, you should rest.  Look.  Why don’t you go in and take a long bath?  I put fresh sheets on the bed.	E309
SKYLER	"With all they’re giving him, he’ll sleep till morning. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      35."	E309
SKYLER	Hey!  Wh... what are you doing here? Not the warmest of receptions.  Ted was already a bit nervous about trying this -- he’s not shocked by her reaction. Still, onward and upward.  Putting an innocent face on it:	E309
SKYLER	Um, Marie, this is Ted.  My boss.	E309
SKYLER	"It was.  It was really nice.  Thank you. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      36."	E309
SKYLER	-- cheese sticks... very good. Marie, nodding, gives a big thumbs-up.  Ted probably doesn’t follow this completely, but he plays along well.	E309
SKYLER	(recovering) Of yeah.  You should.  I’m sorry. Come on in, Ted.	E309
SKYLER	Thanks for stopping by.  But, it’s... actually, not the best time for a visit.  So...	E309
SKYLER	I’m so sorry, you gave me and that time off and I really should have --	E309
SKYLER	Ted, it’s just... this whole thing with Hank has been one non-stop horror show, you know?  So...	E309
SKYLER	"Thank you. (a pregnant pause; then) But I really do need you to... ... Leave.  As in now.  Ted hesitates, not wanting to. Furthermore, he doesn’t get why he even needs to.  Meanwhile, Skyler steps a few feet over to glance down the hall and check if Marie is eavesdropping (no sign of it).  That rubs Ted a little wrong, as well. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      38."	E309
SKYLER	Okay.	E309
SKYLER	Let’s talk about this later, Ted, okay?	E309
SKYLER	Later, Ted.  Not now.	E309
SKYLER	(frustrated; snaps) You really wanna do this now? Are you really gonna make me do this right now? Ouch.  Ted gets it.  We do, too.  She’s talking about breaking up with him.  He’s hurt.  And Skyler deeply regrets having let him know in this manner.  But the damage is done.	E309
SKYLER	"Ted, I’m...  I’ll see you in a day or two?  Back at the office? BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      39."	E309
SKYLER	Jesus.	E309
SKYLER	Walt?  We can always pay their bills. Walt blinks, confused.  Marie frowns, breaking a smile and lifting an eyebrow.  It’s unlike her sister to talk nonsense.	E309
SKYLER	-- We have the money.  More than enough. (then) Walt earned it. Marie glances over at Walt, but he’s blank with confusion -- and PANIC.  What is Skyler doing?!? Suddenly Walt knows with terrible certainty where this is headed -- Skyler is about to tell Marie everything.  Walt steps over to sit next to her, on her opposite side.	E309
SKYLER	"I think Marie should know the truth. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      46."	E309
SKYLER	(to Marie; coolly, simply) He earned it gambling. Gambling?  Now Walt’s simply mystified.  Marie glances from one to the other -- hooked and wanting to hear more.	E309
SKYLER	Walt and I, uh, we’ve had our problems lately.  You know that. And, uh... what it came down to, really, was money.  Pure and simple. Skyler glances at Walt with... is that a touch of empathy?	E309
SKYLER	When Walt was diagnosed -- it, um, it changed him.  Looking back, I don’t think I ever really understood what it was that he was going through.  It was more than facing death.  It was knowing that he was going to leave behind... nothing.  And so that’s how this all started.  For better or worse, he wanted to provide. (then) And so he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how. Walt’s stunned:  this is exactly how he would have explained it himself.  Marie can’t help asking the obvious question.	E309
SKYLER	"Yeah,  thought so, too.  The truth is, he never took their money -- not a dime.  He was too proud to take what he considered to be charity. (to Walt) Isn’t that right? Walt manages a numb nod.  However, Skyler isn’t coming down hard on him here -- she’s simply telling a story. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      47."	E309
SKYLER	So, he put his mind to it, and uh... well, you know how Walt is, he’s-he’s a problem solver.  And he read books and he did a whole bunch of research... and he came up with this system.	E309
SKYLER	A system for counting cards in Blackjack.	E309
SKYLER	Well... no... I don’t pretend to understand, you know, all the details, but he was convinced that if he put enough money into it, he’d have a, um... uh -- (to Walt) God...  What is it?  A “statistical edge?” Walt takes a second to catch up with her.  Barely audible:	E309
SKYLER	"So he, every spare minute, Walt was at some card table somewhere.  At first he went to casinos, but then he realized that... VOICES approach nearby, a pair of NURSES.  Skyler pauses. When they’ve passed by, she continues, her voice lower.  Walt and Marie lean forward, they don’t want to miss a word. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      48."	E309
SKYLER	-- No, no he did not fake that, Marie.  The night that Walt disappeared?  He lost fourteen thousand dollars.  It was his pension fund, our savings. Basically every last dime we had to our name.  Gone. Marie stares open-mouthed at Walt -- whose own mind is racing.  He’s astounded by the complexity, the inventiveness of Skyler’s lie.  But he’s also trying to understand where the lie ends and the truth begins.	E309
SKYLER	"He couldn’t live with it.  He was suicidal. BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      49."	E309
SKYLER	Anyway.  This system of his -- he finally got it to work. In the middle of this emotional roller coaster ride, Walt is beginning to nurse a faint flicker of hope.  After all, Skyler’s proposing to use his drug money for the family -- and that’s a first step towards accepting what he’s done.	E309
SKYLER	So all this is to say... we have the money. (a meaningful look to him) No more gambling -- but we have the money.	E309
SKYLER	Walt..?	E309
SKYLER	Marie, you will take our money. Use it to take care of Hank. Marie is still trying to assimilate all that she’s heard. It’s a gigantic shift in perception.  Walt did this?  Good old reliable, cancer-saint Walt? Hearing this story, she’s got every reason to be angry at him... but hell, I guess he meant well, after all. Sky looks to Walt.  Taking her cue, he makes an earnest plea.	E309
SKYLER	Absolutely not, and I need to keep it that way. (then) And Hank, okay?  Hank’s got enough on his mind, right now.  So, can we just please keep this between us? Walt can’t help but stare at Skyler with admiration:  my God, she’s thought of everything!  Marie nods, agreeing with Sky.	E309
SKYLER	"Yeah, okay.  We’ll talk about it later. Marie exits, leaving Walt and Skyler by themselves.  It takes him a moment to even form the words, but finally: BREAKING BAD #309     ""Kafkaesque""     AS BROADCAST      51."	E309
SKYLER	(staring at him; a beat) I learned from the best. She means Liar Walt, of course.  Walt doesn’t quite know how to take this.  It doesn’t exactly sound like a compliment. Skyler leans in close and lowers her voice.	E309
SKYLER	Somehow, something tells me that Hank is here because of you.  And I’m not forgetting that. Damn right they’ll use the money for Hank’s recovery.  As far as Skyler’s concerned, that’s the only use for this blood money.  She pierces him with a knowing glance and follows Marie without looking back. Forgiveness and understanding are still distant hopes. NEW ANGLE -- looking into the waiting room from up the hall. Walt is framed in the doorway, watching Skyler disappear. Quietly devastated.	E309
SKYLER	"Hank, he just wants to be supportive-- But Walt Jr. softly interrupts his mom and aunt... BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      6."	E311
SKYLER	I am. Skyler holds out a hand -- let’s have it.  Marie reluctantly produces a folded piece of paper, hands it over.  It’s Hank’s	E311
SKYLER	Yeah... Skyler nods... but not a confident one, as the enormity of the situation hits her.  Off her well-faked smile... AN ABSTRACT IMAGE.  A wavy SEA OF BLUE.  We are in...	E311
SKYLER	No.  Your Dad is. Really?  Off Junior, smiling at this unexpected surprise... INT. WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT Two hours later.  Empty sauce-smeared plates tell us that the dinner is well over, as we find Walt in his old chair with baby Holly cradled against his body.	E311
SKYLER	Mmm.	E311
SKYLER	Ah.  A “’Stang,” mm-hmm?	E311
SKYLER	Well, I think this is um... we should probably table this discussion for later.  Your Dad and I have a couple things to talk about, so... Junior sighs.  He gets up, gathering his crutches and heading to his room.	E311
SKYLER	"What is “Ice Station Zebra Associates?” Walt wasn’t expecting questions, so he’s a little thrown. BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      16."	E311
SKYLER	Whose loan-out?	E311
SKYLER	Ohhh-kay... um, does your “guy” know the tax code and regulations for New Mexico?  Cause, there’s very specific paperwork that has to be submitted quarterly on this.	E311
SKYLER	Who is he?  What’s his name?  What are his qualifications?  Walt, this... (lowers her voice) ... money has to be unimpeachable when it reaches Hank and Marie.	E311
SKYLER	But, how do I know that?  I mean, apparently you can’t even tell me the man’s name. Exasperated, Walt thinks he can call her bluff.	E311
SAUL	Hell.  Welcome.  What a pleasure it is to have you!  I’m just gonna call you Skyler, if that’s okay. It’s a lovely name.  Reminds me of a... big beautiful sky.  Walt never told me lucky how lucky he was... prior to recent unfortunate events. Walt watches nervously as his two worlds collide -- Saul fawning over the tall-drink-of-water that is Skyler, and Skyler uneasy that she might accidentally pick up a social disease from the charged and shifty shyster that is Saul.	E311
SAUL	Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only very best with just the right amount of dirty. (laughs; off her stare) That’s a joke.  That’s a joke. It’s funny because you are so clearly very classy.  Here, please, sit down. Saul pulls out a chair for her.  When she’s not looking, Saul gives a quick eyebrow-raise of approval to Walt for landing such a looker.  Walt tries not to notice, taking his own seat as Saul rounds to the business side of his desk.	E311
SAUL	"So.  Walt tells me that you have, uh, some concerns I can alleviate. BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      18."	E311
SKYLER	Uh, yes I do.  I have... concerns. No shit.  Glancing sidelong at Walt, you don’t have to be Kreskin to read her mind.  How the fuck did you end up with THIS guy?  Yet Skyler politely presses forward...	E311
SKYLER	Um, if we’re going to go down this road... and clearly we are, for the sake of my brother-in-law...	E311
SAUL	I’ve heard about him.  Uh, he’s an American hero. Nodding, Saul gives out with the cheesy sympathy like a discount undertaker.  Skyler pauses flatly, then continues.	E311
SKYLER	At any rate, I need some assurances that we’re gonna go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious.	E311
SAUL	Fair enough.  I’ll walk you through the process.  First step is something we like to call “money laundering.”  Alright, take you’re money were represented by say... these jelly beans.	E311
SKYLER	Y’know, I’m a bookkeeper -- so I actually, I know what money laundering is.	E311
SAUL	"Uh-huh. (takes away jelly beans) Well. BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      19."	E311
SKYLER	And as with most things, the Devil is in the details.  So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money?	E311
SAUL	That’s simple.  Walt here came up with a great story about gambling winnings.  Blackjack, right?  Some card-counting system?	E311
SAUL	Well.  You grow more gorgeous by the minute! (then; shrugs) Well, there you have it.  I’ll generate false Currency Transaction Reports out the wazoo, as well as the necessary W-2Gs.  I know a couple casino managers who will jump at the chance to report false losses.  So, win-win for everyone.	E311
SKYLER	But you can’t sell that for very long --	E311
SAUL	(interrupts) Yeah, yeah.  Way ahead of you.  Uh, we declare just enough so as not to arouse suspicion.  Then, Walt’s one- time winnings become seed money for investment.	E311
SKYLER	Investment in what?	E311
SAUL	"Drum roll please... wait for it... (beaming) x. Crickets.  Off their non-reaction: BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      20."	E311
SAUL	Laser Tag!  Seven thousand square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County! Skyler is stone-faced.	E311
SKYLER	Laser Tag.	E311
SAUL	Yeah.  There’s guns and glo-lites, and kids wear the vests and runa round in teams--	E311
SKYLER	(interrupts) Yeah, I actually know what it is. It just that... in relation to Walt, it’s, I mean, it doesn’t make any sense. Walt is a silent, sick observer as these two go at it. Saul’s patience rapidly frays as she questions his methods. Trying to sound like he’s joking:	E311
SAUL	Makes more sense than you two being together!  I’m still trying to figure out how that happened...	E311
SKYLER	Do you even know Walt?  I mean, how would he, of all people, buy a Laser Tag business?  It-it doesn’t add up.	E311
SAUL	It adds up perfectly.  Walt’s a scientist.  Scientists love lasers! Skyler stares at him flatly.  The wind leaves Saul’s sails.	E311
SAUL	Plus, they got bumper boats.  So.	E311
SKYLER	"“Hey everybody, Walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag! Just out of the blue!”  Really? That’s what we’re supposed to tell people -- our family, our friends... the government... BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      21."	E311
SAUL	Okay.  Let me bottom line this for you.  You don’t need to be involved.  Okay?  Because I’ve been doing this for a lot of years, successfully -- believe it or not, without your help! (smiles) So.  Thank you for stopping by. Saul is done.  Skyler stares at him -- they’re at stalemate. Off Walt, not wanting to make a move to remind either of them that he’s sitting there...	E311
SKYLER	Safe and cautious, that’s all I’m asking -- and that man is neither. Walt sighs.	E311
SKYLER	Well, it’s a little late on that. This is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money. Walt considers her.  Screw it -- he makes a big confession.	E311
SKYLER	"If you’re gonna launder money Walt, at least do it right. Skyler climbs out.  After a beat, Walt joins her to look at: BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      26."	E311
SKYLER	You worked here four years.  It’s a business you understand.  It’s a story people will believe.  Not Laser Tag.  This.  This is what we buy. Walt looks at her... what we buy?	E311
SKYLER	You.  This is what you buy. She corrects herself without urging, but still... Skyler is at a level of acceptance Walt would have never dreamed could happen.  Off Walt, eyeing this possible business venture, and an uneasy new stage in their relationship...	E311
SAUL	"That’s it?  That’s what you wanna buy? NEW ANGLE -- the Caddy is Saul’s, of course.  And here he is behind the wheel, Walt seated beside him. The wary look in his eyes tells us Saul isn’t loving the idea.  For his part, Walt probably isn’t doing the world’s greatest job selling it -- this is Skyler’s plan, after all. However, being a good devil’s advocate, Walt shrugs. BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      31."	E311
SAUL	“Wax-on, wax-off” -- was that you? (then) Hey, how come you guys always give with the air freshener?  I explicitly say I want no air freshener and every time I drive away smelling like an Alpine whorehouse. Walt’s not listening.  His attention is elsewhere. Walt’s POV -- a bushy-eyebrowed MAN stands in the wipe-down area, berating an employee (we can’t hear what he’s saying). Fans will recognize him as BOGDAN, Walt’s former boss. Walt’s attitude here is hard to gauge.  Sure he despised this man and this place... but is there a certain nostalgia in his eyes, a yearning for simpler times?	E311
SAUL	All due respect, I don’t see it. So, I vote, I vote no.	E311
SAUL	Is that you talking... or Yoko Ono?	E311
SAUL	"Based on her years of experience in money laundering, I suppose. (before Walt can argue) Lemme tell you something -- if you’re committed enough, you can make any story work.  I once convinced a woman that I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.  Alright?  It has nothing to do with the story! BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      32."	E311
SAUL	Besides, this dump isn’t gonna work because it doesn’t have a Danny. Okay?  There’s no Danny here!	E311
SAUL	Danny runs the Laser Tag.  Danny is the guy who had a vision.  Where others saw a dirt lot, he saw black lights, rubber aliens, teenagers running around with ray guns, right?  He was like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.  And when the stock market took a shit and Danny got in trouble, he went searching for exactly the type of situation that we’re offering.  Okay, Danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat.  In other words, Danny can be trusted.  Completely. (points to Bogdan) That guy?  The guy with the, uh, the eyebrows-that-won’t-quit?  Is he a Danny? Walt looks to Bogdan again.  The answer is clearly no.	E311
SAUL	You buy this place, all you got is a big building that squirts water. You got no Danny here. As Walt absorbs this, and Saul starts the engine... INT. ANDREA’S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER CLOSE ON a cigarette getting stubbed out in an ashtray.  It’s Andrea, reaching across Jesse to get to the end table. It’s afterwards.  She and Jesse are naked in bed (of course, this will be handled discreetly), as she lays her head down on his chest.  Jesse smokes his own cigarette, propped up by a few pillows.  Quiet.  Maybe even wistful.  Is he thinking of Jane?  After a beat:	E311
SKYLER	"Wh-what’s a “Danny?” Walt does his best to explain -- sotto so Walt, Jr. (who is presumably home) doesn’t hear. BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      40."	E311
SKYLER	And he can’t get you another Danny to run the car wash.	E311
SKYLER	What about me? Walt is not sure he heard her right.	E311
SKYLER	Me.  I’ll be the Danny. Walt, appropriately, freaks.	E311
SKYLER	I’m perfectly capable of managing a small business --	E311
SKYLER	"Who else would we trust? BREAKING BAD #311          ""Abiquiu""         AS BROADCAST      41."	E311
SKYLER	Walt, I’m in this, and if I’m in it, I’m gonna do it right.	E311
SKYLER	We’re married.  How am I not in this?	E311
SKYLER	(a bit sheepish now) I never actually got around to filing the papers. Walt is stunned.  And god knows, Skyler is NOT sitting here saying she WANTS to be married to Walt -- not at all.  Truly, she’s got something else on her mind.  Something imminently practical.  Quietly, gravely:	E311
SKYLER	Married couples can’t be compelled to testify against one another.  So there’s that. OFF Walt, head spinning, seeing Skyler in a new light...	E311
GUS	Ah, Walter.  You’re right on time. Please... come in. Walt gives a polite yet hesitant nod as he steps into... INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Walt glances around as he steps through the door -- it looks normal enough.  No armed thugs, no Scarface-type decorations. It looks like... a home. Gus shuts the door and faces Walt.  Walt doesn’t know what he’s in for -- did Gus find out about Jesse stealing?  Will he be taken to task?  Is this the end of Walter White? Then...	E311
GUS	I hope you like Paila Marina... Gus walks off.  Walt stands a frozen beat.  As he follows...	E311
GUS	Come on.  You can help me cook. Walt continues through the place, into... INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Gus washes vegetables at the sink as Walt enters this well- appointed kitchen.  High-end pots and pans -- someone who loves to cook lives here.  Dinner is halfway prepared.	E311
GUS	This is a Chilean dish that I love, but... I never get to make it. Kids won’t eat it.  But, uh...  You know how that is. Expecting trouble around every corner, Walt is surprised he’s not finding any.  Nodding distractedly...	E311
GUS	Do you mind...? He surprises Walt by HANDING him the blade, handle-first.	E311
GUS	Wwould you slice the garlic?  Very thin. Walt examines the blade in his hand.  He can SEE HIMSELF reflected in the shiny stainless. Walt looks up from the knife, considers Gus... who has turned his back to attend to some shallots frying on the stove. It’d be so easy for Walt to plunge this knife into Gus.  Is this a test?  Gus giving him the opportunity for vengeance to see what he will do?  Or is this some twisted show of trust? Walt has to know -- and asks a simple question.  Carefully keeping his voice even, not sounding too suspicious:	E311
GUS	We’re working together... why not break bread together? Walt considers.  Nods.  Sounds... legit.  Gus, still smiling:	E311
GUS	Now... the garlic? Walt again glances at the knife in his hand and the garlic before him.  Off him slicing it thin, just as he was told: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT An hour later.  Over their jointly prepared meal (which looks quite good, Gus is no slouch in the kitchen!), Walt is still on-guard, but less so.  He knows Gus is a master chess player.  But is there a move here?  And what is it? While they eat...	E311
GUS	It always amazes me... the way the senses work in connection to memory. (re: his plate) This stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.  Taken separately, these ingredients alone don’t remind me of anything.  Not very much at all.  But in this precise combination?  The smell of this meal..?  Instantly, it brings me back to my childhood.  How is that possible?	E311
GUS	That’s very interesting. He probably really means this.  Walt nods... but he still can’t be comfortable.  What the fuck is this meal about?! Sensing his discomfort...	E311
GUS	Walter.  I would like to help you, if I could.	E311
GUS	Well, when I first started out, I made a lot of mistakes.  More than I care to admit.  I wish I’d had someone to advise me.  Because this life of ours... it can overwhelm. (a beat) You’re a wealthy man now.  And one must learn to be rich. (smiles faintly) To be poor?  Anyone can manage. Gus sips his wine.  Walt studies him.	E311
GUS	Never make the same mistake twice. Said simply... delivered in a totally casual, friendly manner... and yet what does it mean? Walt nods.  Fair enough.  But he can’t shake the idea that there’s something more to this.  That maybe it’s a warning. Off Walt and Gus, eating...	E311
SKYLER		E307
SAUL	"There it is. Saul proudly turns the camera screen toward us, revealing a PICTURE OF JESSE’S BRUISED FACE. BREAKING BAD #307    ""One Minute""      AS BROADCAST      7."	E307
SAUL	Yo, Adrian.  Rocky called -- he wants his face back. We REVEAL Jesse in his hospital bed, as horrible as the picture showed, and feeling a hundred times worse.  Hank really did a job on him.  He can barely move his jaw, and his left eye is SWOLLEN SHUT from a broken eye socket, his face BRUISED and DISTENDED from a broken cheek bone. Jesse winces -- it hurts all over.  He wants to say “fuck off,” but it pains him too much to talk.  Reactions slightly woozy from a concussion -- his head feels half-full of thick fluid.	E307
SAUL	Come on, I gotta cheer you up. (re: photo) You see that?  That’s your “Get- Outta-Jail FREE” card. Jesse’s good eye follows Saul as he circles around to the other side of the bed.  Saul couldn’t feel more on top of the world...	E307
SAUL	You understand “Get Out of Jail Free” card, right?  I mean, just blink once if you’re following... (moving on) The DEA’s worst nightmare is that face out in public.  They’re gonna have to steer a wide berth of young Master Pinkman.  For fear of the P.R. poop-storm that will rain down on them if this story ever gets out. (happy) I mean, this-this beating?  Best thing for you.  You’re home free. Good, right? (beat) Right. As Saul tries to get a response out of mute Jesse...	E307
SAUL	You’re now officially the ‘cute one’ of the group.  Paul, meet Ringo.  Ringo... Paul.	E307
SAUL	Uh, my advice?  That’s probably not a good strategy.  I mean, they’re scared of you right now.  They want nothing to do with you.  But if you hit them, they’re forced to hit back -- hard.  I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither and yon until someone spills the beans on you and-and anyone associated with you. Present company included. Jesse hears this, and there’s a subtle reaction... something clicking in his head.  Meanwhile, Walt gently chimes in.	E307
SAUL	Hey, I may have overstated the, uh power of your face.	E307
SAUL	You’re so sure.	E307
SAUL	What do you think that was in there?  A bluff?  He wants your brother-in-law.  And there’s gonna be a parade of lawyers creaming their Underoos for a case like that.  I mean, I’d take it myself if it wouldn’t cause so much collateral damage. (even more serious) And him cooking again?  Hey, when -- not if -- he gets caught, and he’s facing twenty years... what’ll he do then?  Believe me, there’s no honor among thieves. (then) Except for us, of course. Walt is stymied.  Saul is right.  Jesse is absolutely going to fuck them over.	E307
SAUL	(considers) If he doesn’t... there may come a time to talk options. Said matter-of-factly... and yet this is darkly ominous.	E307
SKYLER	Do you have a minute?	E307
SKYLER	I guess crime does pay. Any little bit of happiness Walt may have had upon seeing Skyler fades out like a dying light bulb.  But he remains polite, neatly folding the dish towel in his hand.	E307
SKYLER	No.  We need to talk. (then) You heard about Hank.  About what happened with this, um, Jesse Pinkman. Walt, so far beyond lying anymore, nods.	E307
SKYLER	Whatever Hank was investigating... Him trying to find an RV.  Is there any danger that could lead back to you? This question catches Walt (and us) a little off-guard.  Is Skyler showing concern for Walt’s safety?  Walt doesn’t think too much about it... she might just be nosy.	E307
SKYLER	I’m here to talk about Hank.  You know what’s gonna happen to him if this Pinkman presses charges. (off his look) Hank could lose everything. Walt nods, somber.  He agrees.  And so?	E307
SKYLER	I thought maybe, um... there’s a way you could help him.	E307
SKYLER	"Contact Pinkman.  Get him to drop these charges. Walt considers her a moment.  Choosing his words carefully... BREAKING BAD #307    ""One Minute""      AS BROADCAST      18."	E307
SKYLER	-- I’m not asking.	E307
SKYLER	I’m not asking.  But there must be something you can say.  Isn’t it even worth a try?  Hank is your family.	E307
SKYLER	What?	E307
SKYLER	Hi, I hope we’re not too late.	E313
SKYLER	Okay.  Stan, this is my husband Walt.	E313
SKYLER	So... this is it, honey. (off his polite nod) Whaddya say?  Do you wanna take a tour	E313
SKYLER	Okay.	E313
SKYLER	Okay, thanks.	E313
SKYLER	He’s actually a nice guy.  He doesn’t push.	E313
SKYLER	So, as you can see, there’s a kinda flow going on here.  It’s a nice big living room.  And this is the, um, dining area.	E313
SKYLER	(tah-dah!) Oh, and uh... it’s got a pool...	E313
SKYLER	Three.  Told you.  They’re all pretty good size. (re: the nursery) Oh, and this is the first one here. And there’s-there’s two more at the back.	E313
SKYLER	(good-natured) Five?  What, do I look like I’m about to drop a litter?	E313
SKYLER	Okay, um, about a wine cellar?  I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar.	E313
SKYLER	Walt, this is a good neighborhood. It’s got a good elementary, and supposedly a very good high school. And believe me, ‘cause I have definitely looked everywhere -- for our price range, this is as good as it gets.	E313
SKYLER	Did you win the lottery and not tell me? They’re back in the hall by this point.  Walt grins and pulls her close.  They are full-frame, in SILHOUETTE.	E313
MIKE	Walter.  You’ve been busy. (then) You wanna put your arms out to your sides for me, if you would. Walt does as he’s told, standing motionless as Mike gives him a quick yet thorough pat-down.  Mike’s an old pro at this. All clear.  Mike motions politely -- after you -- and the two of them head for the Suburban, walking side-by-side.	E313
MIKE	You know I haven’t slept since Thursday?  I was out all night cleaning up after you.  I need my sleep. Mike isn’t angry, just matter-of-fact.  More than that, actually.  Is he surprised?  Is this grudging admiration? Today, he’s seeing Walt in a whole new light.	E313
MIKE	Yeah?  Funny how words can be so open to interpretation. (glancing back) You get your car fixed?	E313
MIKE	You’re gonna wanna get your car fixed.	E313
GUS	Has your condition worsened?	E313
GUS	Your medical condition.  Has it grown worse?	E313
GUS	Is there a ringing in your ears? (Walt shakes his head) Are you seeing bright lights, or hearing voices? Walt stares.  Gives the slightest shake of his head.	E313
GUS	"No, clearly you’re not.  No rational person would do as you have done. (I’m waiting!) Explain yourself. Unlike Mike, Gus is angry.  In control as always, we can nevertheless hear it in his voice -- he’s downright pissed. Nervous as he is, Walt stands his ground.  Doesn’t flinch. BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       10."	E313
GUS	Some worthless junkie.  For him you “intervene” and put us all at risk. Some contemptible junkie who couldn’t keep the peace for eight hours.	E313
GUS	I heard about it.  He should have let me take care of them.	E313
GUS	Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?	E313
GUS	Where is Pinkman now?	E313
MIKE	I dunno, Walt.  It’s what I do, after all. Walt glances to Mike, then back to Gus.	E313
GUS	What is Option B?	E313
GUS	You’d need a new assistant.	E313
GUS	No.  This time I choose. Walt may not love this, but he can’t argue.  He’s lucky to be alive.  He nods.  Agreed. Done with Walt, Gus turns and heads back to the Suburban. Victor does too, climbing behind the wheel. Walt hesitates only a moment before he realizes he’s been dismissed.  He turns and starts off on the long walk back to his Aztek.  We PULL him away from here. As we pass Mike, he turns our way, calling after Walt:	E313
MIKE	Your car.  Get it fixed.	E313
MIKE	I’ll bet he’d come running -- BOOM,	E313
MIKE	Well... a little.  But he’d probably knock everything over. Plus, there’s that big nose of his.	E313
MIKE	Is that so?	E313
MIKE	"Huh.  I learn all kinds of things being with you. BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       16."	E313
MIKE	Okay, Junebug, these are for you? The little girl frowns up at the three measly balloons she’s got, then points at the dozen more that are still in the car.	E313
MIKE	The rest are for me.	E313
MIKE	Oh, you’re never too old for balloons. Mike shuts the door, serious about keeping them.  He bends down -- careful, bad back! -- and gives her a hug and a peck on the cheek.	E313
MIKE	Give me a hug.  I see your Mom. Don’t keep her waiting.	E313
MIKE	"Bye, baby. The girl prances off, headed up the walkway of a nearby house.  A WOMAN in her thirties stands waiting on the porch. She waves to Mike, who waves back. Ah, what a kind, sweet granddad Mike is.  But what does he want with those balloons? BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       17."	E313
MIKE	Chow.  You have anything you wanna tell me?	E313
MIKE	They keep you prisoner.	E313
MIKE	You’re a businessman.  The lady out front -- (calls down the hall) Hey lady, are you still there? (back to Chow) Ask her if she’s still there.	E313
MIKE	How’s her driving? Chow blinks, confused by the question.  Helping him out, his gun still in hand, Mike mimes a steering wheel.	E313
MIKE	Driving.  Is she good behind the wheel?	E313
MIKE	"Licensed?  Dependable? BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       22."	E313
MIKE	Good. Abruptly, Mike raises his pistol and -- THUP! -- puts one through Chow’s raised LEFT HAND.  AAAAAHH! Chow grips his BLEEDING palm, his face contorted in agony. Mike turns his back on him, squats down to check the nearest dead man for ID.  Over Chow’s whimpers of pain:	E313
MIKE	The trucks’ll be here first thing in the morning.  I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time. (hearing no movement) So..?  Have her drive you to the hospital. Holding his hand, Chow rises and stumbles toward the hallway. Just as he clears frame...	E313
GUS	Where’d they cross?	E313
MIKE	"Laredo, looks like. (shrugs) They didn’t exactly send their “A” players.  But like you said, it’s cartel, alright. BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       23."	E313
GUS	Probing for weakness.	E313
GUS	What about Pinkman?	E313
MIKE	I’m making inquiries. Gus stares -- find him, his look says.  Mike exits.	E313
GUS	Gale.  It’s good to see you.	E313
GUS	I should have called first.  I’m not interrupting anything, am I?	E313
GUS	Oh, no... no, thank you.  I’m sorry for the inconvenience --	E313
GUS	I need to talk to you about something.  Something rather pressing. They’re seated now.  Gale is all ears.  As it’s a delicate subject, Gus considers how best to begin.  Finally:	E313
GUS	If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself. You, and, uh, an assistant. Gale thinks about this for a moment.	E313
GUS	Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work..?	E313
GUS	Oh, it is.  But specifically, has he ever spoken to you about his health problems? (off Gale’s frown) I’m not surprised.  He’s a very private person.	E313
GUS	He’s dying of cancer. Gale looks stricken.  Never one for displays of emotion, Gus nonetheless (for Gale’s sake) seems to share his pain.	E313
GUS	It is why he does this.  To provide for his family.  Which he’s accomplished.  They will never want for anything -- he’s seen to that.	E313
GUS	That is very much the question. He does not want to talk about it. And every time I bring it up with him... (shakes his head; bad) I don’t know that he’s fully accepted the reality of it.  And, not to sound cold-blooded... but I am running a business here.	E313
GUS	"I have a very large investment in this. BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       28."	E313
GUS	Now, I intend to keep Walter on for as long as he wants, assuming he’s physically up to it.  But as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be... (regretful) I must prepare for the worst-case scenario. Gale nods.  Silence for a moment -- then Gale realizes Gus is waiting for an answer to his original question.	E313
GUS	You don’t think you’re ready now?	E313
GUS	I believe in you, Gale.  I know that when the time comes, you will be ready. Off Gus, smooth, warm and genuine... and (though Gale doesn’t know it) clearly planning Walt’s demise:	E313
SAUL	Yeah. (listens; then) Tell him I’m in conference. He clicks off and shuts his eyes, enjoying the ride. After a moment or two, we hear the o.s. DOOR open and close. FOOTSTEPS pad toward Saul.  A SHADOW falls across him.  Saul opens one eye, squinting up at this unwanted visitor.	E313
SAUL	Can’t you see I’m in conference? Reveal MIKE stands over Saul.	E313
MIKE	I’m looking to find a client of yours.  I was hoping you could help me out with an address.	E313
SAUL	Which client?	E313
MIKE	Jesse Pinkman. Saul frowns up at Mike, raising an eyebrow.	E313
SAUL	"“Jesse-Pinkman-In-The-Phone-Book” Jesse Pinkman?  Hmm, how would one track him down, I wonder? BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       31."	E313
SAUL	(annoyed) You’re still here..?	E313
MIKE	I’m gonna need your full attention, Saul.  Jesse Pinkman.  Current whereabouts.  The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to... (indicates machine) ... Whatever the hell this is exactly.	E313
SAUL	What am I, eighth-grade hall monitor?  “Current whereabouts?” Lemme tell you something -- Saul starts to rise in protest -- but Mike stops him with a warning hand.	E313
MIKE	Whoa.  You are good right there. Mike doesn’t shove, nor raise his voice.  There’s no need. Saul... reluctantly... remains where he is on the floor. Mike takes hold of one of the client chairs, pulls it close.	E313
MIKE	Let’s both get comfortable. Mike parks the chair right next to Saul, who lies propped up on his elbows.  Mike takes a seat, looming over Saul.	E313
MIKE	Now... when I say I’m looking for Pinkman, we both know why.  Don’t we?  And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.	E313
SAUL	(growing nervous) Look, Mike... there are rules to this lawyer thing.	E313
MIKE	"Is that right? BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       32."	E313
SAUL	Yeah.  “Attorney-client privilege?” I mean, that’s a big one!  And that’s something I provide for you! So, if I give up Pinkman... well, then you’re gonna be asking “old Saul gives ‘em up pretty easy. What’s to keep him from giving me up?” (shrug) You see?  So, then, where’s the trust?	E313
MIKE	I trust the hole in the desert I’d leave you in.	E313
SAUL	(distantly) Y-Yeah... that’s an argument. Mike leans a bit closer.  Stays calm and conversational.	E313
MIKE	Saul, don’t make me beat you till your legs don’t work.  Now tell me where to find him. (then) You know it’s the right thing. Saul considers his options.  From deep within, he finds his inner Clarence Darrow.  His hidden strength.  Gravely:	E313
SAUL	I can’t tell you, Mike.  Alright? I -- look.  If I was to tell you, well I just... I couldn’t live with myself.  I’m sorry. Wow.  Mike sighs and regretfully rises to his feet.  He moves his chair, making room so he can kick the shit outta Saul. And, just as quickly, Clarence Darrow goes away.	E313
SAUL	"(holds up his hands) But who’s to say I didn’t write the address down in-in my day-planner? Seeing where this is headed, Mike lets him up.  Saul scrambles to his feet and rounds his desk, rifling through his scheduler.  Not finding what he’s looking for... BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       33."	E313
SAUL	Or on a... scratch piece of paper... somewhere... (where the fuck is it?!) ... Who’s to say I didn’t write down a location?  Strictly for my own professional use. Yes!  Finding it written on a notepad, Saul tosses the pad atop his desk.  He points a finger at Mike -- NOW HEAR THIS!	E313
SAUL	"Believe me, money-laundering ain’t what it used to be. (half to himself) God, do I miss the eighties. BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       34."	E313
SAUL	Well, one look at this place, you’re gonna fall in love, so... Our two guys ride on in silence.	E313
SAUL	"You ever actually play laser tag? You know... it’s good cardio.  Plus you get to shoot at kids... BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       35."	E313
SAUL	You got your bumper cars over there down the way.  Got your arcade right here -- all the latest video games.  Snack bar’s over there. Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents.  That’s a whole new revenue stream...	E313
SAUL	Holy Christ. Saul stops dead, puts his hands on his knees and sucks in a deep, ragged breath.  It’s as if he’s trying not to faint. With his eyes, he shoots Walt daggers.	E313
SAUL	“We’re GOOD?”  This constitutes “good” where you’re from?  My car is bugged --	E313
SAUL	-- I’m being followed?!  What the hell have you gotten me into?!  I got my very own PI threatening to break my legs!  That’s like Thomas Magnum threatening, that, that... (can’t think of it) ... Little prissy guy with the mustache... Another deep breath.  Recovering, Saul stands up straight.	E313
SAUL	"Over and above.  Service-wise, this is over and above.  You and I survive this?  Oh, I’m seriously rethinking my pricing.  Yeah. BREAKING BAD #313         ""Full Measure""        AS BROADCAST       36."	E313
SAUL	My guy’s no dummy, right?  So, I give us maybe twenty-four hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere. (off the grim silence) You guys do your thing, make it snappy.  I’ll go... see if they have Tetris or something. Shaking his head to himself, nervous Saul wanders off toward the arcade, leaving Walt and Jesse alone.  A beat.	E313
MIKE	I don’t know if it’s a barrel leak or what... but you got something mighty stinky down there. (motions gallantly) After you. Down in the lab -- that’s where they’ll kill me, thinks Walt. Make it look like an accident, for Gale’s sake.  No threats have been made, no guns are in evidence.  But Walt knows if he goes down into that lab, he’s done. Walt stares behind the enormous machine, breathing a little faster now.  He’s frozen.  Mike, mild and even, as always:	E313
MIKE	Walter.  The sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home. Walt does something surprising now.  Something we probably don’t expect. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE.  Low and scared:	E313
MIKE	Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter. Downstairs.	E313
MIKE	No... no...	E313
MIKE	Shut up.  Shut up.  I can’t do it. I’m sorry.	E313
MIKE	Where is he right now?  You give me an address.	E313
MIKE	Now, just what the hell was that, exactly? Walt sets his jaw, gazes coolly.  He doesn’t answer.  He even has the intestinal wherewithal to fix his crooked collar, just now pulled askew by Victor. Strongly sensing he’s been had, Mike finally draws a GUN from his jacket pocket (not the HK from Act Two, but something smaller).  Victor does the same. Amazingly, Walt doesn’t flinch, doesn’t quake.  Far from it.	E313
MIKE	(cocks the hammer) Yeah?  Why?	E313
SKYLER	(softly, to Holly) Hi!  You’re a sweet girl... yes you are... yes you are... yes you are. (beat) I know... The sound of TIRES out in the driveway turns her attention. She closes her laptop and gently disengages her daughter. EXT. WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS The Aztek is parked in the driveway.  The engine shuts off and Junior opens his driver’s door, retrieving his crutches from the backseat.  Walt rounds from the passenger side.	E312
SKYLER	Hey.	E312
SKYLER	(to Walt) Hi.  Um, do you have a minute? (off his nod; to Junior) Could you, uh, go in and keep an eye on your sister for me? Walter, Jr. takes that as his cue to head inside the house.	E312
SKYLER	Have you thought anymore about what we discussed?	E312
SKYLER	So, show me the flaw in it.	E312
SKYLER	Hey, I don’t love this situation, alright?  That you put me in! However, let’s just stick with what makes sense here:  You took the seed money you won gambling, you invested it in the car wash that you helped run for four years.  You hired your wife as a bookkeeper, because guess what?  She’s actually a bookkeeper.  Now, that is a story an auditor can believe.  So what am I missing?	E312
SKYLER	"Okay, my estranged husband, who -- when he was working -- made forty- three thousand dollars a year, starts shoveling money at me.  And when the police come, I’m supposed to say “Gee, I, uh, never thought about it, officers.  Made sense to me!”  Really?  That, in your mind, is “plausible deniability.” (off his silence) I tell you what, Walt... BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    9."	E312
SKYLER	That, it seems to me, is the safest way to make the best of a very bad situation, yes.	E312
SKYLER	Because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation. Though it may be hopeless and futile... then again, he’d try anything.	E312
SKYLER	Wow.  Suddenly a fantasy story. Realizing this is a battle he will only lose, Walt instead turns it into a negotiation.	E312
SKYLER	"Not every night, no. BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    10."	E312
SKYLER	Dinner two nights.  Not weekends. With twenty-four hours’ notice.	E312
SKYLER	Three.  Six hours’ notice.	E312
SKYLER	Four. (as he opens his mouth) Don’t push it. Walt considers, sighs... then nods (all of that horse-trading should play pretty fast, but not sitcom-fast).	E312
SKYLER	No.	E312
SAUL	(re: game) Bitch... (finally glances over) You know I’m hourly, right? Walt checks his watch for the 39th time.	E312
SAUL	(dry) Oh, he “promised”?  Why didn’t you tell me?  Let’s wait then. Walt sits there, staring off, like he hadn’t heard.	E312
SAUL	That’s a joke.  The kid ain’t coming. Walt stands, begins to pace. Saul quits his game, stretches.	E312
SAUL	Okay, so, what’s Plan B?	E312
SAUL	Well, let’s brainstorm. Saul leans back in his chair, steeples his fingers.	E312
SAUL	You really think he’s serious?	E312
SAUL	Okay, so, what?  We pay him off.	E312
SAUL	(frowns, dubious) You-you want your criminal associate taken into police custody?	E312
SAUL	"(still not convinced) Pinkman in jail?  I don’t know: I’m picturing it and my... BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    23."	E312
SAUL	(smartass beat) That’s jail. (catching on) You’re talking about a level 2 joint.	E312
SAUL	(thinking out loud) Well, you know, Roswell Correctional’s pretty low impact, you know.  In the past, I’ve recommended Springer, but I’m hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated. So.	E312
SAUL	(shrugs) Well, it falls under my Premium Services Package, but you can afford that. Saul picks up his phone and dials.	E312
SAUL	"I’ll call my P.I. Off Walt:  nodding, hopeful for this Plan B. BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    24."	E312
MIKE	(coolly insisting) This isn’t a phone talk, Walter. Your wife’s out, right? Walt hesitates.  He’s not crazy about letting this guy inside his home, but this sounds serious.  Walt stands aside, closing the door quickly after Mike enters.	E312
MIKE	(smiling, re: Holly) Aw, isn’t she somethin’.  I got a granddaughter a few years older. Uneasy about these two worlds of his colliding, Walt picks her up and loads her into the bassinet.	E312
MIKE	Have a seat, Walter. Nice try.  Walt grudgingly sits.	E312
MIKE	I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.	E312
MIKE	Well, I’m not gonna do it.	E312
MIKE	"Because it’s moronic. BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    27."	E312
MIKE	(shrugs, ‘maybe’) That’s not the moronic part.	E312
MIKE	The problem is... the Boss wouldn’t like it.	E312
MIKE	My boss. (adds meaningfully) Your boss. Mike works for Gus?!  This is news to Walt.  Troubling news. It’s another sign of Gus’ extensive, subterranean reach.	E312
MIKE	This is a professional courtesy. No one knows I’m here.  Understand? Walt nods, numb.	E312
MIKE	"But our employer would find out. Like always.  And, if Pinkman were arrested... he’d take it as a problem. (level gaze) Walt, you got a good thing going here.  We all do.  You want to risk it all on one junkie? That’s a good question.  These days, who knows what Jesse will do?  What he’s capable of?  Walt certainly doesn’t. BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    28."	E312
MIKE	Now, I realize you two have a history, but this kid’s been on the bubble a while now.  It’s a long time comin’. Walt gets a chill.	E312
MIKE	Um... I used to be a beat cop, long time ago.  And I’d get called out on domestic disputes all the time. Hundreds, probably, over the years. But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit that I will never forget.  Gordie.  He looked like Bo Svenson.  You remember him? “Walking Tall?”  You don’t remember?	E312
MIKE	"Well, of course.  Just trying to do the right thing. (then) But two weeks later he killed her. Of course.  Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender.  We got there, there was so much blood, you could taste the metal. (then) BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    30."	E312
MIKE	No more half measures, Walter. OFF WALT:  Staring off, stuck.  Thinking the unthinkable...	E312
MIKE	Gonna need you to come with me. Before Jesse can protest, VICTOR opens the passenger door and leans over Wendy.	E312
GUS	Sit down. Jesse takes the empty seat in front of him.  Victor and Mike sit nearby, ready in case they’re needed. Gus begins with quiet authority.  He states the case simply and accurately with an almost judicial detachment.	E312
GUS	I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees. Jesse’s putting it together -- this is the guy, the “boss.” The one he was never allowed to meet.  Jesse doesn’t quite have the nerve to meet Gus’ questioning glance.	E312
GUS	It is true that they killed one of your associates.  It is possible they acted rashly.  But, on the other hand, there was provocation. The man was selling on their territory. (including the Bulletheads) There is blame on both sides. (a hint more force) This will go no further.  It will be settled right here, right now. But Jesse’s looking at Walt.  He can see Walt’s not here against his will.  And if that’s true...	E312
GUS	"Wait outside. BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    35."	E312
GUS	Listen to me.  You have one friend in this room. (pointing at Walt) This man. Walt stays seated --- and silent.  The body language makes it clear; Gus is the boss here.  There’s no trace of “Heisenberg” now; Walt has become a submissive company man.	E312
GUS	Those men outside are my trusted employees.  And when I learned what you intended to do... Gus can barely contain his contempt for the cowardice and stupidity of Jesse’s plan.  He lets his words trail off, not finishing his thought.  But his meaning is very clear.	E312
GUS	If it wasn’t for this man -- and the respect I have for him -- I would be dealing with this in a very different way. Jesse cuts his eyes over to Walt.	E312
GUS	"You don’t look at him.  You look at me. (Jesse complies, then) This is what happens now.  My men will come back inside.  And you will shake their hands and you will make peace.  And that will be the end of this. He doesn’t need to say “or else.”  There’s no choice here. Jesse must knuckle under to survive. But... something won’t allow him to go along.  Something deep inside him rebels.  He returns Gus’ stare.  And says simply: BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    36."	E312
GUS	(to Jesse) Pardon me? Jesse rises to his feet and forces himself to look right at Gus.  As scared as he is, Jesse’s not backing down.  Even Gus is surprised by Jesse’s quiet bravery.	E312
GUS	"(to Mike) Bring them back. Mike goes to the door and signals to Victor.  Jesse doesn’t take his eyes off Gus as Victor leads the Bulletheads back in.  The drug dealers don’t go back to their chairs, they stand across from Jesse, waiting for Gus to give the word. BREAKING BAD #312       ""Half Measures""    AS BROADCAST    37."	E312
GUS	(to the Bulletheads) No more children. Glances of confusion around the room.	E312
GUS	Understand? The Bulletheads glance at each other, pissed.  Somehow Jesse talked the boss into muscling into their business.  Still, they nod.  An order from Gus is not to be questioned.	E312
GUS	(to Jesse) And you.  You keep the peace. Jesse nods.  Not quite believing this outcome.	E312
GUS	Say it.	E312
GUS	Shake hands. Jesse slowly reaches out and shakes the hands of each of Combo’s killers in turn.  Walt’s relieved but also deeply humiliated.  He’s never stood up to Gus like this, never even imagined it.  Off Jesse -- has he just won a victory?	E312
SKYLER	Dinner’s almost ready, okay?	E312
SKYLER	(shrugs) Yeah, okay. He nods and continues down the hallway. INT. WHITE HOUSE - BATHROOM - EVENING Walt enters, closes the door and turns on the sink.  He takes out his phone and dials.	E312
SKYLER	(good-naturedly) So the TV turns itself off, huh?	E312
SKYLER	Can you turn that off? Walt doesn’t hear her.  He’s fixated on the TV screen.	E312
SKYLER	Walt.	E312
SKYLER	(quiet, to Walter, Jr.) ... for your dad. (beat, to Walt) I’m sorry, it’s just, uh, they’ve been talking about that all day. And it’s just...	E312
SKYLER	Hey, uh, did you know your Dad and I are thinking about maybe starting a business together? Walt, Jr. likes the sound of that.  Yet another hopeful sign for the White family household.	E312
SKYLER	Um, we’re thinking maybe a car wash.	E312
SKYLER	Do you have any thought about how we’re going to approach this with Walter, Jr?	E306
SKYLER	-- Of course.  My point being -- the divorce.	E306
SKYLER	(bitterly sarcastic) “MY unhappiness.”  My completely, out-of-the-clear-blue-sky unhappiness.  Really?	E306
SKYLER	Yeah, okay... um...  Last thing, and then I’ll let you go. (re:  papers) Um in the Child Support Worksheet... you list... medical, dental, child care, transportation, housing, education, food, clothing...	E306
SKYLER	Walt... no.	E306
SKYLER	Not with that money!  You’d be making us accessories after the fact! Walt’s eyes narrow.  Pretty legalistic of her.  He considers a moment.  Answers mildly, yet coldly.	E306
GUS	So we try to clean them every night.  But make sure it’s off before you open the intake valve... Gus watches patiently as his employee gives it a try.	E306
GUS	Good.  Now, I suggest that you add this to your Monday maintenance schedule...	E306
GUS	Ah... morning.	E306
GUS	Why?  They’re doing nothing wrong. And furthermore, I don’t wish to discuss it -- that’s the polite and subtle message here, which the Manager receives.	E306
GUS	"Okay, let’s put this pepper here... BREAKING BAD #306       ""Sunset""     SCRIPT AS BROADCAST    19"	E306
SAUL	"Is this a secure..?  Yes, what’s with the..? BREAKING BAD #306       ""Sunset""     SCRIPT AS BROADCAST    31"	E306
SAUL	(oh shit) Okay, I’m listening.	E306
SAUL	What RV?	E306
SAUL	Okay.  Yeah... what exactly does “knows about” mean?  Does he have it, has he searched it --	E306
SAUL	-- So get rid of it!  What’re you doing sitting there talking to me for?! (quickly reconsiders) Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it!  Right?  You don’t you go near it! Walt shakes his head -- no, no, no.	E306
SAUL	Jesus.  Plan A, then.  Go!  Get to it before the feds do!	E306
SAUL	what do I look like, the RV disposal people?  Did you not plan for this contingency?	E306
SAUL	Well... next time plan for it, wouldja?!  The Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button!  I’m just saying.	E306
GUS	What can I do for you?	E306
GUS	"Sunset. The Cousins seem to know what this means.  One rises, then the other... EXITING without another glance at Gus.  Who watches them go, his eyes hinting at an inner rage we’ve never seen before.  OFF this... BREAKING BAD #306       ""Sunset""     SCRIPT AS BROADCAST    37"	E306
GUS	I told you before.  You will not kill Walter White.  Not until my business with him has concluded. One of the Cousins responds quietly, also in Spanish.  He doesn’t glare or grimace or otherwise threaten -- really, he doesn’t need to.  These dudes are scary without even trying.	E306
GUS	You’ll have to.  The decision isn’t yours to make. This doesn’t go over well with these two.  In fact, the body language all around feels a little like an Old West showdown. But before it can turn into the OK Corral...	E306
GUS	Explain to me -- why this man White?  He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes... but he’s not the one who murdered him. (off their stares) Was there not another man who pulled the trigger? A beat.  The first Cousin nods, speaks grudgingly.	E306
GUS	North of the border is my territory.  My say. (then) As a show of respect, I say yes. The Cousins glance to one another, mild surprise showing in their faces.  They didn’t see this coming.	E306
GUS	The agent’s name is Hank Schrader. (a beat) May his death satisfy you. Ice-cold.  Off the Cousins, coming around to this bold new idea... and mild Gus, not so much as blinking... And the red SUN sinking to the horizon behind them...	E306
SKYLER	(smiling) Close.  Two months to the day.	E301
SKYLER	I really just need this quick and easy.  As quick as, you know, something like this can be.	E301
SKYLER	I mean, he certainly knows we’re separated.  So...	E301
SKYLER	We’re in the process of moving him out.  Yeah.  Today, hopefully.  In the meantime, my son and daughter and I are staying with my sister.	E301
SKYLER	Well, just temporarily.  Only until he could get his things together. That was supposed to be last week, but then came the crash, and...	E301
SKYLER	(nodding) -- Right beneath the flight path. We had debris land right in our yard, all over our neighborhood...	E301
SKYLER	Apparently, you know, even... parts of bodies..?  I mean, I couldn’t bring myself to go over there.	E301
SKYLER	God, I know.  Anyway, I certainly wasn’t ready to move us back. But... it’s time.  And we’re driving my sister and her husband up a wall, I’m sure.	E301
SKYLER	Yeah.  Holly here, and a son in high school -- Walter, Junior. (firm now) They need to stay with me.	E301
SKYLER	"Sixteen years. BREAKING BAD #301     ""No Mas""    WHITE   8/3/09     11."	E301
SKYLER	-- Definitely a mortgage.  We’ve got maybe fifteen years on it.	E301
SKYLER	Yes.  He’s a high school teacher. Chemistry teacher.	E301
SKYLER	I pretty much supported us while he did some post-doctoral work.  But really, here’s the thing:  I am not looking for any kind of loopholes, or, I dunno --	E301
SKYLER	The financial end of things is something he and I can deal with. We’ll split everything fifty-fifty and just be done with it.  So... (thin smile) Yeah.  Quick and easy’s all I need. Ohhh-kay.  This attorney knows there’s some very big detail that Skyler is choosing to leave out.  The woman studies her for a moment -- then shoots gently, but straight.	E301
SKYLER	Okay.  I will think about that. Off the two of them shaking hands -- friendly, but strained:	E301
SKYLER	Honey, want another waffle..? (a beat) Still got the iron out.  I could cut up some bananas... Jesus, homemade waffles, even.  Unfortunately, this does nothing to thaw Walter, Jr.  Now, their kitchen phone RINGS.	E301
SKYLER	Would you please just -- She changes her mind about stopping him.  It doesn’t matter anyhow.  Ignoring his mom as studiously as she ignores her husband’s message, the teenager picks up the receiver.	E301
SKYLER	Flynn... Walt, Jr. still won’t look at her.  Strictly into the phone:	E301
SKYLER	I’ll take you to school.	E301
SKYLER	Flynn, I’m taking you to school.	E301
SKYLER	(quiet, yet patient) Well, hello to you, too.	E301
SKYLER	(overlapping her) Marie...  Marie. Marie finally throws up her hands.	E301
SKYLER	I don’t remember asking you, alright?  You wanna be supportive? Be supportive without all this prying, for god’s sake.	E301
SKYLER	Is this a good time to talk?	E301
SKYLER	-- No, I should have called first.	E301
SKYLER	Sure.	E301
SKYLER	No, I’m fine.	E301
SKYLER	I’m fine.  Thanks.	E301
SKYLER	Yeah.  Let’s sit. Walt pulls together a couple of chairs (maybe detouring in a very brief attempt to make the bed).  They both sit. Skyler is running this show, and her discomfort is apparent as she tries to find the right way to begin.  The silence, meanwhile, is killing Walt.  So...	E301
SKYLER	-- I’m not punishing you, Walt.	E301
SKYLER	You’re a drug dealer. She says this quietly, evenly -- shocking us.  Walt blinks.	E301
SKYLER	"Yeah.  Yeah.  Where else could you possibly make that kind of money? (after another moment) Marijuana..?  That Pinkman kid..? BREAKING BAD #301     ""No Mas""    WHITE   8/3/09     36. His silent expression inadvertently tells her “try again.”"	E301
SKYLER	I’m gonna make you a deal, Walt. I won’t tell Hank... or your children... or anybody else. Nobody will ever hear it from me. But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.	E301
SKYLER	I mean it.  You understand? (breathing faster) Now lemme the hell out of here before I throw up. She’s not exaggerating.  Walt reluctantly steps aside. Quickly, Skyler is out the door and gone. Off Walt, left all alone way down here at rock-bottom...	E301
GUS	Is the food to your satisfaction?	E301
GUS	Good to see you again. Gus offers his hand, and they shake.	E301
GUS	May I..? Walt motions to the seat opposite -- by all means.  Gus sits down with him.  Smooth.  If anyone in the place is paying attention... and they certainly aren’t... they’d think Gus is spending a few moments with an associate, and nothing more. Gus keeps his voice low, but not to the point of whispering. After all, this is his place.  He knows the Muzak and the sizzle of the fryers will cover up anything he says.	E301
GUS	I have an offer that I think will interest you.	E301
GUS	I’d like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.	E301
GUS	Three million dollars for three months of your time. Holy crap!!  Holy... WHAT?  Did we just hear that right?! Walt blinks.  Stares.  Uhhh...	E301
GUS	Three months, then out.	E301
GUS	May I take this as a “yes?” We’re thinking it’s leaning that way, definitely.  And yet... ... And yet, Walt’s expression saddens.  Darkens.  He gives a tiny little shake of his head.  Soft, half to himself:	E301
